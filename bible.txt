Genesis 9:3	Every moving thing that liveth shall be food for you; as the green herb have I given you all.
Genesis 9:4	But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.
Genesis 9:5	And surely your blood, the blood of your lives, will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it: and at the hand of man, even at the hand of every man’s brother, will I require the life of man.

Genesis 9:10	and with every living creature that is with you, the fowl, the cattle, and every beast of the earth with you; of all that go out of the ark, even every beast of the earth.
Genesis 9:11	And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of the flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
Genesis 9:12	And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
Genesis 9:13	I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.
Genesis 9:14	And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud,
Genesis 9:15	and I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
Genesis 9:16	And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
Genesis 9:17	And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.
Genesis 9:18	And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.
Genesis 9:19	These three were the sons of Noah: and of these was the whole earth overspread.
Genesis 9:20	And Noah began to be an husbandman, and planted a vineyard:
Genesis 9:21	and he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.
Genesis 9:22	And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.
Genesis 9:23	And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father’s nakedness.
Genesis 9:24	And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his youngest son had done unto him.
Genesis 9:25	And he said, Cursed be Canaan; A servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.
Genesis 9:26	And he said, Blessed be the LORD, the God of Shem; And let Canaan be his servant.
Genesis 9:27	God enlarge Japheth, And let him dwell in the tents of Shem; And let Canaan be his servant.
Genesis 9:28	And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.
Genesis 9:29	And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.
Genesis 10:1	Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem Ham and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.
Genesis 10:2	The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.
Genesis 10:3	And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.
Genesis 10:4	And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.
Genesis 10:5	Of these were the isles of the nations divided in their lands, every one after his tongue; after their families, in their nations.
Genesis 10:6	And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Put, and Canaan.
Genesis 10:7	And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabteca: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan.
Genesis 10:8	And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.
Genesis 10:9	He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before the LORD.
Genesis 10:10	And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.
Genesis 10:11	Out of that land he went forth into Assyria, and builded Nineveh, and Rehoboth-Ir, and Calah,
Genesis 10:12	and Resen between Nineveh and Calah (the same is the great city).
Genesis 10:13	And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,
Genesis 10:14	and Pathrusim, and Casluhim (whence went forth the Philistines), and Caphtorim.
Genesis 10:15	And Canaan begat Zidon his firstborn, and Heth;
Genesis 10:16	and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgashite;
Genesis 10:17	and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite;
Genesis 10:18	and the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanite spread abroad.
Genesis 10:19	And the border of the Canaanite was from Zidon, as thou goest toward Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest toward Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim, unto Lasha.
Genesis 10:20	These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, in their nations.
Genesis 10:21	And unto Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth, to him also were children born.
Genesis 10:22	The sons of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arpachshad, and Lud, and Aram.
Genesis 10:23	And the sons of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.
Genesis 10:24	And Arpachshad begat Shelah; and Shelah begat Eber.
Genesis 10:25	And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of the one was Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother’s name was Joktan.
Genesis 10:26	And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah;
Genesis 10:27	and Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah;
Genesis 10:28	and Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba;
Genesis 10:29	and Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan.
Genesis 10:30	And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest toward Sephar, the mountain of the east.
Genesis 10:31	These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.
Genesis 10:32	These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and of these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.
Genesis 11:1	And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech.
Genesis 11:2	And it came to pass, as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.
Genesis 11:3	And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them throughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar.
Genesis 11:4	And they said, Go to, let us build us a city, and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven, and let us make us a name; lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
Genesis 11:5	And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.
Genesis 11:6	And the LORD said, Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language; and this is what they begin to do: and now nothing will be withholden from them, which they purpose to do.
Genesis 11:7	Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech.
Genesis 11:8	So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.
Genesis 11:9	Therefore was the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.
Genesis 11:10	These are the generations of Shem. Shem was an hundred years old, and begat Arpachshad two years after the flood:
Genesis 11:11	and Shem lived after he begat Arpachshad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.
Genesis 11:12	And Arpachshad lived five and thirty years, and begat Shelah:
Genesis 11:13	and Arpachshad lived after he begat Shelah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.
Genesis 11:14	And Shelah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:
Genesis 11:15	and Shelah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.
Genesis 11:16	And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:
Genesis 11:17	and Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters.
Genesis 11:18	And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:
Genesis 11:19	and Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters.
Genesis 11:20	And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:
Genesis 11:21	and Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.
Genesis 11:22	And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:
Genesis 11:23	and Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.
Genesis 11:24	And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:
Genesis 11:25	and Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters.
Genesis 11:26	And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
Genesis 11:27	Now these are the generations of Terah. Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.
Genesis 11:28	And Haran died in the presence of his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.
Genesis 11:29	And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram’s wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor’s wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.
Genesis 11:30	And Sarai was barren; she had no child.
Genesis 11:31	And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his son’s son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram’s wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.
Genesis 11:32	And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.
Genesis 12:1	Now the LORD said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, unto the land that I will shew thee:
Genesis 12:2	and I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and be thou a blessing:
Genesis 12:3	and I will bless them that bless thee, and him that curseth thee will I curse: and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
Genesis 12:4	So Abram went, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
Genesis 12:5	And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother’s son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
Genesis 12:6	And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the oak of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
Genesis 12:7	And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him.
Genesis 12:8	And he removed from thence unto the mountain on the east of Beth-el, and pitched his tent, having Beth-el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD.
Genesis 12:9	And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the South.
Genesis 12:10	And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was sore in the land.
Genesis 12:11	And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
Genesis 12:12	and it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
Genesis 12:13	Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake, and that my soul may live because of thee.
Genesis 12:14	And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
Genesis 12:15	And the princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house.
Genesis 12:16	And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he-asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she-asses, and camels.
Genesis 12:17	And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram’s wife.
Genesis 12:18	And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
Genesis 12:19	Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so that I took her to be my wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
Genesis 12:20	And Pharaoh gave men charge concerning him: and they brought him on the way, and his wife, and all that he had.
Genesis 13:1	And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the South.
Genesis 13:2	And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.
Genesis 13:3	And he went on his journeys from the South even to Beth-el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth-el and Ai;
Genesis 13:4	unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.
Genesis 13:5	And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.
Genesis 13:6	And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
Genesis 13:7	And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram’s cattle and the herdmen of Lot’s cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land.
Genesis 13:8	And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we are brethren.
Genesis 13:9	Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou take the right hand, then I will go to the left.
Genesis 13:10	And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the Plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as thou goest unto Zoar.
Genesis 13:11	So Lot chose him all the Plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.
Genesis 13:12	Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the Plain, and moved his tent as far as Sodom.
Genesis 13:13	Now the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners against the LORD exceedingly.
Genesis 13:14	And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art, northward and southward and eastward and westward:
Genesis 13:15	for all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.
Genesis 13:16	And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.
Genesis 13:17	Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for unto thee will I give it.
Genesis 13:18	And Abram moved his tent, and came and dwelt by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD.
Genesis 14:1	And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim,
Genesis 14:2	that they made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar).
Genesis 14:3	All these joined together in the vale of Siddim (the same is the Salt Sea).
Genesis 14:4	Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
Genesis 14:5	And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim,
Genesis 14:6	and the Horites in their mount Seir, unto El-paran, which is by the wilderness.
Genesis 14:7	And they returned, and came to En-mishpat (the same is Kadesh), and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon-tamar.
Genesis 14:8	And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar); and they set the battle in array against them in the vale of Siddim;
Genesis 14:9	against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings against the five.
Genesis 14:10	Now the vale of Siddim was full of slime pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and they fell there, and they that remained fled to the mountain.
Genesis 14:11	And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
Genesis 14:12	And they took Lot, Abram’s brother’s son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
Genesis 14:13	And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew: now he dwelt by the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner; and these were confederate with Abram.
Genesis 14:14	And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he led forth his trained men, born in his house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued as far as Dan.
Genesis 14:15	And he divided himself against them by night, he and his servants, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
Genesis 14:16	And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
Genesis 14:17	And the king of Sodom went out to meet him, after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him, at the vale of Shaveh (the same is the King’s Vale).
Genesis 14:18	And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was priest of God Most High.
Genesis 14:19	And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth:
Genesis 14:20	and blessed be God Most High, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him a tenth of all.
Genesis 14:21	And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.
Genesis 14:22	And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD, God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth,
Genesis 14:23	that I will not take a thread nor a shoelatchet nor aught that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
Genesis 14:24	save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me; Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre, let them take their portion.
Genesis 15:1	After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
Genesis 15:2	And Abram said, O Lord GOD, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and he that shall be possessor of my house is Dammesek Eliezer?
Genesis 15:3	And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
Genesis 15:4	And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This man shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
Genesis 15:5	And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to tell them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
Genesis 15:6	And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
Genesis 15:7	And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.
Genesis 15:8	And he said, O Lord GOD, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?
Genesis 15:9	And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she-goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
Genesis 15:10	And he took him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each half over against the other: but the birds divided he not.
Genesis 15:11	And the birds of prey came down upon the carcases, and Abram drove them away.
Genesis 15:12	And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
Genesis 15:13	And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
Genesis 15:14	and also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
Genesis 15:15	But thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
Genesis 15:16	And in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full.
Genesis 15:17	And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a flaming torch that passed between these pieces.
Genesis 15:18	In that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:
Genesis 15:19	the Kenite, and the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite,
Genesis 15:20	and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Rephaim,
Genesis 15:21	and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Girgashite, and the Jebusite.
Genesis 16:1	Now Sarai Abram’s wife bare him no children: and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.
Genesis 16:2	And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained me from bearing; go in, I pray thee, unto my handmaid; it may be that I shall obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.
Genesis 16:3	And Sarai Abram’s wife took Hagar the Egyptian, her handmaid, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to Abram her husband to be his wife.
Genesis 16:4	And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
Genesis 16:5	And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I gave my handmaid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee.
Genesis 16:6	But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thy hand; do to her that which is good in thine eyes. And Sarai dealt hardly with her, and she fled from her face.
Genesis 16:7	And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.
Genesis 16:8	And he said, Hagar, Sarai’s handmaid, whence camest thou? and whither goest thou? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.
Genesis 16:9	And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.
Genesis 16:10	And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will greatly multiply thy seed, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.
Genesis 16:11	And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with child, and shalt bear a son; and thou shalt call his name Ishmael, because the LORD hath heard thy affliction.
Genesis 16:12	And he shall be as a wild-ass among men; his hand shall be against every man, and every man’s hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.
Genesis 16:13	And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou art a God that seeth: for she said, Have I even here looked after him that seeth me?
Genesis 16:14	Wherefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.
Genesis 16:15	And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called the name of his son, which Hagar bare, Ishmael.
Genesis 16:16	And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram.
Genesis 17:1	And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am God Almighty; walk before me, and be thou perfect.
Genesis 17:2	And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly.
Genesis 17:3	And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,
Genesis 17:4	As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be the father of a multitude of nations.
Genesis 17:5	Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for the father of a multitude of nations have I made thee.
Genesis 17:6	And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.
Genesis 17:7	And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee and to thy seed after thee.
Genesis 17:8	And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land of thy sojournings, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.
Genesis 17:9	And God said unto Abraham, And as for thee, thou shalt keep my covenant, thou, and thy seed after thee throughout their generations.
Genesis 17:10	This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; every male among you shall be circumcised.
Genesis 17:11	And ye shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of a covenant betwixt me and you.
Genesis 17:12	And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every male throughout your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed.
Genesis 17:13	He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
Genesis 17:14	And the uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
Genesis 17:15	And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.
Genesis 17:16	And I will bless her, and moreover I will give thee a son of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of peoples shall be of her.
Genesis 17:17	Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?
Genesis 17:18	And Abraham said unto God, Oh that Ishmael might live before thee!
Genesis 17:19	And God said, Nay, but Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant for his seed after him.
Genesis 17:20	And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
Genesis 17:21	But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.
Genesis 17:22	And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.
Genesis 17:23	And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham’s house, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.
Genesis 17:24	And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
Genesis 17:25	And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
Genesis 17:26	In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son.
Genesis 17:27	And all the men of his house, those born in the house, and those bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.
Genesis 18:1	And the LORD appeared unto him by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;
Genesis 18:2	and he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood over against him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself to the earth,
Genesis 18:3	and said, My lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:
Genesis 18:4	let now a little water be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:
Genesis 18:5	and I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your heart; after that ye shall pass on: forasmuch as ye are come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.
Genesis 18:6	And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes.
Genesis 18:7	And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetched a calf tender and good, and gave it unto the servant; and he hasted to dress it.
Genesis 18:8	And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
Genesis 18:9	And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.
Genesis 18:10	And he said, I will certainly return unto thee when the season cometh round; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard in the tent door, which was behind him.
Genesis 18:11	Now Abraham and Sarah were old, and well stricken in age; it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.
Genesis 18:12	And Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?
Genesis 18:13	And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?
Genesis 18:14	Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the set time I will return unto thee, when the season cometh round, and Sarah shall have a son.
Genesis 18:15	Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.
Genesis 18:16	And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.
Genesis 18:17	And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that which I do;
Genesis 18:18	seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
Genesis 18:19	For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; to the end that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.
Genesis 18:20	And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;
Genesis 18:21	I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
Genesis 18:22	And the men turned from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.
Genesis 18:23	And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou consume the righteous with the wicked?
Genesis 18:24	Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
Genesis 18:25	That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked, that so the righteous should be as the wicked; that be far from thee: shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
Genesis 18:26	And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sake.
Genesis 18:27	And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes:
Genesis 18:28	peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, I will not destroy it, if I find there forty and five.
Genesis 18:29	And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for the forty’s sake.
Genesis 18:30	And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.
Genesis 18:31	And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for the twenty’s sake.
Genesis 18:32	And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for the ten’s sake.
Genesis 18:33	And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.
Genesis 19:1	And the two angels came to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot saw them, and rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face to the earth;
Genesis 19:2	and he said, Behold now, my lords, turn aside, I pray you, into your servant’s house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your way. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
Genesis 19:3	And he urged them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
Genesis 19:4	But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both young and old, all the people from every quarter;
Genesis 19:5	and they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
Genesis 19:6	And Lot went out unto them to the door, and shut the door after him.
Genesis 19:7	And he said, I pray you, my brethren, do not so wickedly.
Genesis 19:8	Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; forasmuch as they are come under the shadow of my roof.
Genesis 19:9	And they said, Stand back. And they said, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and drew near to break the door.
Genesis 19:10	But the men put forth their hand, and brought Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
Genesis 19:11	And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
Genesis 19:12	And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whomsoever thou hast in the city; bring them out of the place:
Genesis 19:13	for we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.
Genesis 19:14	And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy the city. But he seemed unto his sons in law as one that mocked.
Genesis 19:15	And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
Genesis 19:16	But he lingered; and the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
Genesis 19:17	And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the Plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
Genesis 19:18	And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my lord:
Genesis 19:19	behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest evil overtake me, and I die:
Genesis 19:20	behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.
Genesis 19:21	And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow the city of which thou hast spoken.
Genesis 19:22	Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
Genesis 19:23	The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot came unto Zoar.
Genesis 19:24	Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;
Genesis 19:25	and he overthrew those cities, and all the Plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
Genesis 19:26	But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.
Genesis 19:27	And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the LORD:
Genesis 19:28	and he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the Plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace.
Genesis 19:29	And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the Plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.
Genesis 19:30	And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
Genesis 19:31	And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
Genesis 19:32	come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
Genesis 19:33	And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he knew not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
Genesis 19:34	And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
Genesis 19:35	And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he knew not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
Genesis 19:36	Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.
Genesis 19:37	And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
Genesis 19:38	And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben-ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.
Genesis 20:1	And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the land of the South, and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur; and he sojourned in Gerar.
Genesis 20:2	And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.
Genesis 20:3	But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, because of the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man’s wife.
Genesis 20:4	Now Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay even a righteous nation?
Genesis 20:5	Said he not himself unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and the innocency of my hands have I done this.
Genesis 20:6	And God said unto him in the dream, Yea, I know that in the integrity of thy heart thou hast done this, and I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.
Genesis 20:7	Now therefore restore the man’s wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.
Genesis 20:8	And Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.
Genesis 20:9	Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and wherein have I sinned against thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
Genesis 20:10	And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?
Genesis 20:11	And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife’s sake.
Genesis 20:12	And moreover she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife:
Genesis 20:13	and it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father’s house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
Genesis 20:14	And Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and menservants and womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife.
Genesis 20:15	And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee.
Genesis 20:16	And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, it is for thee a covering of the eyes to all that are with thee; and in respect of all thou art righted.
Genesis 20:17	And Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children.
Genesis 20:18	For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham’s wife.
Genesis 21:1	And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken.
Genesis 21:2	And Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.
Genesis 21:3	And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.
Genesis 21:4	And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him.
Genesis 21:5	And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him.
Genesis 21:6	And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh; every one that heareth will laugh with me.
Genesis 21:7	And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should give children suck? for I have borne him a son in his old age.
Genesis 21:8	And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.
Genesis 21:9	And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had borne unto Abraham, mocking.
Genesis 21:10	Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.
Genesis 21:11	And the thing was very grievous in Abraham’s sight on account of his son.
Genesis 21:12	And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah saith unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
Genesis 21:13	And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.
Genesis 21:14	And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.
Genesis 21:15	And the water in the bottle was spent, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.
Genesis 21:16	And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not look upon the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.
Genesis 21:17	And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.
Genesis 21:18	Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation.
Genesis 21:19	And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
Genesis 21:20	And God was with the lad, and he grew; and he dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.
Genesis 21:21	And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.
Genesis 21:22	And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:
Genesis 21:23	now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son’s son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.
Genesis 21:24	And Abraham said, I will swear.
Genesis 21:25	And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of the well of water, which Abimelech’s servants had violently taken away.
Genesis 21:26	And Abimelech said, I know not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but today.
Genesis 21:27	And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and they two made a covenant.
Genesis 21:28	And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
Genesis 21:29	And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?
Genesis 21:30	And he said, These seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that it may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.
Genesis 21:31	Wherefore he called that place Beer-sheba; because there they sware both of them.
Genesis 21:32	So they made a covenant at Beer-sheba: and Abimelech rose up, and Phicol the captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.
Genesis 21:33	And Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the Everlasting God.
Genesis 21:34	And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days.
Genesis 22:1	And it came to pass after these things, that God did prove Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham; and he said, Here am I.
Genesis 22:2	And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son, whom thou lovest, even Isaac, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
Genesis 22:3	And Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son; and he clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.
Genesis 22:4	On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.
Genesis 22:5	And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass, and I and the lad will go yonder; and we will worship, and come again to you.
Genesis 22:6	And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took in his hand the fire and the knife; and they went both of them together.
Genesis 22:7	And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold, the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?
Genesis 22:8	And Abraham said, God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son: so they went both of them together.
Genesis 22:9	And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, upon the wood.
Genesis 22:10	And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.
Genesis 22:11	And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.
Genesis 22:12	And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from me.
Genesis 22:13	And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, behind him a ram caught in the thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.
Genesis 22:14	And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be provided.
Genesis 22:15	And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham a second time out of heaven,
Genesis 22:16	and said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:
Genesis 22:17	that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
Genesis 22:18	and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.
Genesis 22:19	So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer-sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba.
Genesis 22:20	And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she also hath borne children unto thy brother Nahor;
Genesis 22:21	Uz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram;
Genesis 22:22	and Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.
Genesis 22:23	And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight did Milcah bear to Nahor, Abraham’s brother.
Genesis 22:24	And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she also bare Tebah, and Gaham, and Tahash, and Maacah.
Genesis 23:1	And the life of Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years: these were the years of the life of Sarah.
Genesis 23:2	And Sarah died in Kiriath-arba (the same is Hebron), in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.
Genesis 23:3	And Abraham rose up from before his dead, and spake unto the children of Heth, saying,
Genesis 23:4	I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
Genesis 23:5	And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,
Genesis 23:6	Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.
Genesis 23:7	And Abraham rose up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth.
Genesis 23:8	And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,
Genesis 23:9	that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for the full price let him give it to me in the midst of you for a possession of a buryingplace.
Genesis 23:10	Now Ephron was sitting in the midst of the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,
Genesis 23:11	Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.
Genesis 23:12	And Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land.
Genesis 23:13	And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt, I pray thee, hear me: I will give the price of the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.
Genesis 23:14	And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,
Genesis 23:15	My lord, hearken unto me: a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
Genesis 23:16	And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the children of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.
Genesis 23:17	So the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the border thereof round about, were made sure
Genesis 23:18	unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.
Genesis 23:19	And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre (the same is Hebron), in the land of Canaan.
Genesis 23:20	And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the children of Heth.
Genesis 24:1	And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things.
Genesis 24:2	And Abraham said unto his servant, the elder of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:
Genesis 24:3	and I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:
Genesis 24:4	but thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son Isaac.
Genesis 24:5	And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest?
Genesis 24:6	And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.
Genesis 24:7	The LORD, the God of heaven, that took me from my father’s house, and from the land of my nativity, and that spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife for my son from thence.
Genesis 24:8	And if the woman be not willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath; only thou shalt not bring my son thither again.
Genesis 24:9	And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning this matter.
Genesis 24:10	And the servant took ten camels, of the camels of his master, and departed; having all goodly things of his master’s in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.
Genesis 24:11	And he made the camels to kneel down without the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time that women go out to draw water.
Genesis 24:12	And he said, O LORD, the God of my master Abraham, send me, I pray thee, good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham.
Genesis 24:13	Behold, I stand by the fountain of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water:
Genesis 24:14	and let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.
Genesis 24:15	And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.
Genesis 24:16	And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the fountain, and filled her pitcher, and came up.
Genesis 24:17	And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Give me to drink, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher.
Genesis 24:18	And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.
Genesis 24:19	And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.
Genesis 24:20	And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw, and drew for all his camels.
Genesis 24:21	And the man looked stedfastly on her; holding his peace, to know whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not.
Genesis 24:22	And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden ring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold;
Genesis 24:23	and said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee. Is there room in thy father’s house for us to lodge in?
Genesis 24:24	And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.
Genesis 24:25	She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.
Genesis 24:26	And the man bowed his head, and worshipped the LORD.
Genesis 24:27	And he said, Blessed be the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who hath not forsaken his mercy and his truth toward my master: as for me, the LORD hath led me in the way to the house of my master’s brethren.
Genesis 24:28	And the damsel ran, and told her mother’s house according to these words.
Genesis 24:29	And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the fountain.
Genesis 24:30	And it came to pass, when he saw the ring, and the bracelets upon his sister’s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the fountain.
Genesis 24:31	And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.
Genesis 24:32	And the man came into the house, and he ungirded the camels; and he gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the men’s feet that were with him.
Genesis 24:33	And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.
Genesis 24:34	And he said, I am Abraham’s servant.
Genesis 24:35	And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks and herds, and silver and gold, and menservants and maidservants, and camels and asses.
Genesis 24:36	And Sarah my master’s wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.
Genesis 24:37	And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:
Genesis 24:38	but thou shalt go unto my father’s house, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son.
Genesis 24:39	And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me.
Genesis 24:40	And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father’s house:
Genesis 24:41	then shalt thou be clear from my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give her not to thee, thou shalt be clear from my oath.
Genesis 24:42	And I came this day unto the fountain, and said, O LORD, the God of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go:
Genesis 24:43	behold, I stand by the fountain of water; and let it come to pass, that the maiden which cometh forth to draw, to whom I shall say, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink;
Genesis 24:44	and she shall say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the same be the woman whom the LORD hath appointed for my master’s son.
Genesis 24:45	And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the fountain, and drew: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee.
Genesis 24:46	And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.
Genesis 24:47	And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the ring upon her nose, and the bracelets upon her hands.
Genesis 24:48	And I bowed my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master’s brother’s daughter for his son.
Genesis 24:49	And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.
Genesis 24:50	Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.
Genesis 24:51	Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master’s son’s wife, as the LORD hath spoken.
Genesis 24:52	And it came to pass, that, when Abraham’s servant heard their words, he bowed himself down to the earth unto the LORD.
Genesis 24:53	And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.
Genesis 24:54	And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master.
Genesis 24:55	And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.
Genesis 24:56	And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.
Genesis 24:57	And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth.
Genesis 24:58	And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.
Genesis 24:59	And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham’s servant, and his men.
Genesis 24:60	And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of ten thousands, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them.
Genesis 24:61	And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.
Genesis 24:62	And Isaac came from the way of Beer-lahai-roi; for he dwelt in the land of the South.
Genesis 24:63	And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, there were camels coming.
Genesis 24:64	And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel.
Genesis 24:65	And she said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant said, It is my master: and she took her veil, and covered herself.
Genesis 24:66	And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.
Genesis 24:67	And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death.
Genesis 25:1	And Abraham took another wife, and her name was Keturah.
Genesis 25:2	And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.
Genesis 25:3	And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.
Genesis 25:4	And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.
Genesis 25:5	And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.
Genesis 25:6	But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts; and he sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.
Genesis 25:7	And these are the days of the years of Abraham’s life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.
Genesis 25:8	And Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.
Genesis 25:9	And Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre;
Genesis 25:10	the field which Abraham purchased of the children of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.
Genesis 25:11	And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed Isaac his son; and Isaac dwelt by Beer-lahai-roi.
Genesis 25:12	Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s handmaid, bare unto Abraham:
Genesis 25:13	and these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebaioth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,
Genesis 25:14	and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa;
Genesis 25:15	Hadad, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:
Genesis 25:16	these are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages, and by their encampments; twelve princes according to their nations.
Genesis 25:17	And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.
Genesis 25:18	And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: he abode in the presence of all his brethren.
Genesis 25:19	And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son: Abraham begat Isaac:
Genesis 25:20	and Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian, to be his wife.
Genesis 25:21	And Isaac entreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren: and the LORD was entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.
Genesis 25:22	And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, wherefore do I live? And she went to inquire of the LORD.
Genesis 25:23	And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, And two peoples shall be separated even from thy bowels: And the one people shall be stronger than the other people; And the elder shall serve the younger.
Genesis 25:24	And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.
Genesis 25:25	And the first came forth red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.
Genesis 25:26	And after that came forth his brother, and his hand had hold on Esau’s heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.
Genesis 25:27	And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.
Genesis 25:28	Now Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: and Rebekah loved Jacob.
Genesis 25:29	And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came in from the field, and he was faint:
Genesis 25:30	and Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.
Genesis 25:31	And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.
Genesis 25:32	And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall the birthright do to me?
Genesis 25:33	And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.
Genesis 25:34	And Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: so Esau despised his birthright.
Genesis 26:1	And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar.
Genesis 26:2	And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:
Genesis 26:3	sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father;
Genesis 26:4	and I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these lands; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;
Genesis 26:5	because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.
Genesis 26:6	And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:
Genesis 26:7	and the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, My wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah: because she was fair to look upon.
Genesis 26:8	And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.
Genesis 26:9	And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife: and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.
Genesis 26:10	And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lain with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.
Genesis 26:11	And Abimelech charged all the people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.
Genesis 26:12	And Isaac sowed in that land, and found in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.
Genesis 26:13	And the man waxed great, and grew more and more until he became very great:
Genesis 26:14	and he had possessions of flocks, and possessions of herds, and a great household: and the Philistines envied him.
Genesis 26:15	Now all the wells which his father’s servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth.
Genesis 26:16	And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.
Genesis 26:17	And Isaac departed thence, and encamped in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.
Genesis 26:18	And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.
Genesis 26:19	And Isaac’s servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.
Genesis 26:20	And the herdmen of Gerar strove with Isaac’s herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they contended with him.
Genesis 26:21	And they digged another well, and they strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah.
Genesis 26:22	And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.
Genesis 26:23	And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba.
Genesis 26:24	And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham’s sake.
Genesis 26:25	And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac’s servants digged a well.
Genesis 26:26	Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his host.
Genesis 26:27	And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore are ye come unto me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?
Genesis 26:28	And they said, We saw plainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there now be an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;
Genesis 26:29	that thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD.
Genesis 26:30	And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.
Genesis 26:31	And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.
Genesis 26:32	And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac’s servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water.
Genesis 26:33	And he called it Shibah: therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba unto this day.
Genesis 26:34	And when Esau was forty years old he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:
Genesis 26:35	and they were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.
Genesis 27:1	And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his elder son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Here am I.
Genesis 27:2	And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death.
Genesis 27:3	Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me venison;
Genesis 27:4	and make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.
Genesis 27:5	And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.
Genesis 27:6	And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,
Genesis 27:7	Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD before my death.
Genesis 27:8	Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee.
Genesis 27:9	Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as he loveth:
Genesis 27:10	and thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, so that he may bless thee before his death.
Genesis 27:11	And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.
Genesis 27:12	My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.
Genesis 27:13	And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.
Genesis 27:14	And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.
Genesis 27:15	And Rebekah took the goodly raiment of Esau her elder son, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son:
Genesis 27:16	and she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck:
Genesis 27:17	and she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.
Genesis 27:18	And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I; who art thou, my son?
Genesis 27:19	And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy firstborn; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.
Genesis 27:20	And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God sent me good speed.
Genesis 27:21	And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.
Genesis 27:22	And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.
Genesis 27:23	And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau’s hands: so he blessed him.
Genesis 27:24	And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.
Genesis 27:25	And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son’s venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine, and he drank.
Genesis 27:26	And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.
Genesis 27:27	And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son Is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed:
Genesis 27:28	And God give thee of the dew of heaven, And of the fatness of the earth, And plenty of corn and wine:
Genesis 27:29	Let peoples serve thee, And nations bow down to thee: Be lord over thy brethren, And let thy mother’s sons bow down to thee: Cursed be every one that curseth thee, And blessed be every one that blesseth thee.
Genesis 27:30	And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.
Genesis 27:31	And he also made savoury meat, and brought it unto his father; and he said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son’s venison, that thy soul may bless me.
Genesis 27:32	And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy firstborn, Esau.
Genesis 27:33	And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who then is he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be blessed.
Genesis 27:34	When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with an exceeding great and bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father.
Genesis 27:35	And he said, Thy brother came with guile, and hath taken away thy blessing.
Genesis 27:36	And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?
Genesis 27:37	And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what then shall I do for thee, my son?
Genesis 27:38	And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.
Genesis 27:39	And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, of the fatness of the earth shall be thy dwelling, And of the dew of heaven from above;
Genesis 27:40	And by thy sword shalt thou live, and thou shalt serve thy brother; And it shall come to pass when thou shalt break loose, That thou shalt shake his yoke from off thy neck.
Genesis 27:41	And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.
Genesis 27:42	And the words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah; and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to kill thee.
Genesis 27:43	Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran;
Genesis 27:44	and tarry with him a few days, until thy brother’s fury turn away;
Genesis 27:45	until thy brother’s anger turn away from thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?
Genesis 27:46	And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these, of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?
Genesis 28:1	And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.
Genesis 28:2	Arise, go to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother’s father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother’s brother.
Genesis 28:3	And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a company of peoples;
Genesis 28:4	and give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land of thy sojournings, which God gave unto Abraham.
Genesis 28:5	And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Paddan-aram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob’s and Esau’s mother.
Genesis 28:6	Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan-aram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;
Genesis 28:7	and that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Paddan-aram:
Genesis 28:8	and Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father;
Genesis 28:9	and Esau went unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham’s son, the sister of Nebaioth, to be his wife.
Genesis 28:10	And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went toward Haran.
Genesis 28:11	And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took one of the stones of the place, and put it under his head, and lay down in that place to sleep.
Genesis 28:12	And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.
Genesis 28:13	And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD, the God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed;
Genesis 28:14	and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
Genesis 28:15	And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee whithersoever thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.
Genesis 28:16	And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew it not.
Genesis 28:17	And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.
Genesis 28:18	And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put under his head, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it.
Genesis 28:19	And he called the name of that place Beth-el: but the name of the city was Luz at the first.
Genesis 28:20	And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,
Genesis 28:21	so that I come again to my father’s house in peace, then shall the LORD be my God,
Genesis 28:22	and this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be God’s house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.
Genesis 29:1	Then Jacob went on his journey, and came to the land of the children of the east.
Genesis 29:2	And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, three flocks of sheep lying there by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and the stone upon the well’s mouth was great.
Genesis 29:3	And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well’s mouth in its place.
Genesis 29:4	And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they said, Of Haran are we.
Genesis 29:5	And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him.
Genesis 29:6	And he said unto them, Is it well with him? And they said, It is well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.
Genesis 29:7	And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and feed them.
Genesis 29:8	And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and they roll the stone from the well’s mouth; then we water the sheep.
Genesis 29:9	While he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep; for she kept them.
Genesis 29:10	And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother’s brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother’s brother.
Genesis 29:11	And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.
Genesis 29:12	And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s brother, and that he was Rebekah’s son: and she ran and told her father.
Genesis 29:13	And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister’s son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.
Genesis 29:14	And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month.
Genesis 29:15	And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy wages be?
Genesis 29:16	And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.
Genesis 29:17	And Leah’s eyes were tender; but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured.
Genesis 29:18	And Jacob loved Rachel; and he said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.
Genesis 29:19	And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me.
Genesis 29:20	And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her.
Genesis 29:21	And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.
Genesis 29:22	And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.
Genesis 29:23	And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.
Genesis 29:24	And Laban gave Zilpah his handmaid unto his daughter Leah for an handmaid.
Genesis 29:25	And it came to pass in the morning that, behold, it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?
Genesis 29:26	And Laban said, It is not so done in our place, to give the younger before the firstborn.
Genesis 29:27	Fulfill the week of this one, and we will give thee the other also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.
Genesis 29:28	And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife.
Genesis 29:29	And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her handmaid.
Genesis 29:30	And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.
Genesis 29:31	And the LORD saw that Leah was hated, and he opened her womb: but Rachel was barren.
Genesis 29:32	And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Because the LORD hath looked upon my affliction; for now my husband will love me.
Genesis 29:33	And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the LORD hath heard that I am hated, he hath therefore given me this son also: and she called his name Simeon.
Genesis 29:34	And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have borne him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi.
Genesis 29:35	And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, This time will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and she left bearing.
Genesis 30:1	And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and she said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die.
Genesis 30:2	And Jacob’s anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I in God’s stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?
Genesis 30:3	And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; that she may bear upon my knees, and I also may obtain children by her.
Genesis 30:4	And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in unto her.
Genesis 30:5	And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son.
Genesis 30:6	And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan.
Genesis 30:7	And Bilhah Rachel’s handmaid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second son.
Genesis 30:8	And Rachel said, With mighty wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali.
Genesis 30:9	When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her handmaid, and gave her to Jacob to wife.
Genesis 30:10	And Zilpah Leah’s handmaid bare Jacob a son.
Genesis 30:11	And Leah said, Fortunate! and she called his name Gad.
Genesis 30:12	And Zilpah Leah’s handmaid bare Jacob a second son.
Genesis 30:13	And Leah said, Happy am I! for the daughters will call me happy: and she called his name Asher.
Genesis 30:14	And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son’s mandrakes.
Genesis 30:15	And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken away my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son’s mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to-night for thy son’s mandrakes.
Genesis 30:16	And Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for I have surely hired thee with my son’s mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.
Genesis 30:17	And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob a fifth son.
Genesis 30:18	And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I gave my handmaid to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.
Genesis 30:19	And Leah conceived again, and bare a sixth son to Jacob.
Genesis 30:20	And Leah said, God hath endowed me with a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun.
Genesis 30:21	And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.
Genesis 30:22	And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb.
Genesis 30:23	And she conceived, and bare a son: and said, God hath taken away my reproach:
Genesis 30:24	and she called his name Joseph, saying, The LORD add to me another son.
Genesis 30:25	And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country.
Genesis 30:26	Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service wherewith I have served thee.
Genesis 30:27	And Laban said unto him, If now I have found favour in thine eyes, tarry: for I have divined that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake.
Genesis 30:28	And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.
Genesis 30:29	And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle hath fared with me.
Genesis 30:30	For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it hath increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee whithersoever I turned: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?
Genesis 30:31	And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me aught: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed thy flock and keep it.
Genesis 30:32	I will pass through all thy flock today, removing from thence every speckled and spotted one, and every black one among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my hire.
Genesis 30:33	So shall my righteousness answer for me hereafter, when thou shalt come concerning my hire that is before thee: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and black among the sheep, that if found with me shall be counted stolen.
Genesis 30:34	And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.
Genesis 30:35	And he removed that day the he-goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons;
Genesis 30:36	and he set three days’ journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban’s flocks.
Genesis 30:37	And Jacob took him rods of fresh poplar, and of the almond and of the plane tree; and peeled white strakes in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.
Genesis 30:38	And he set the rods which he had peeled over against the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs where the flocks came to drink; and they conceived when they came to drink.
Genesis 30:39	And the flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks brought forth ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.
Genesis 30:40	And Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked and all the black in the flock of Laban; and he put his own droves apart, and put them not unto Laban’s flock.
Genesis 30:41	And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger of the flock did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods;
Genesis 30:42	but when the flock were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban’s, and the stronger Jacob’s.
Genesis 30:43	And the man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, and maidservants and menservants, and camels and asses.
Genesis 31:1	And he heard the words of Laban’s sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that was our father’s; and of that which was our father’s hath he gotten all this glory.
Genesis 31:2	And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as beforetime.
Genesis 31:3	And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.
Genesis 31:4	And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock,
Genesis 31:5	and said unto them, I see your father’s countenance, that it is not toward me as beforetime; but the God of my father hath been with me.
Genesis 31:6	And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.
Genesis 31:7	And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.
Genesis 31:8	If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the flock bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be thy wages; then bare all the flock ringstraked.
Genesis 31:9	Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me.
Genesis 31:10	And it came to pass at the time that the flock conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the he-goats which leaped upon the flock were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled.
Genesis 31:11	And the angel of God said unto me in the dream, Jacob: and I said, Here am I.
Genesis 31:12	And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the he-goats which leap upon the flock are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.
Genesis 31:13	I am the God of Beth-el, where thou anointedst a pillar, where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy nativity.
Genesis 31:14	And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father’s house?
Genesis 31:15	Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath also quite devoured our money.
Genesis 31:16	For all the riches which God hath taken away from our father, that is ours and our children’s: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.
Genesis 31:17	Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon the camels;
Genesis 31:18	and he carried away all his cattle, and all his substance which he had gathered, the cattle of his getting, which he had gathered in Paddan-aram, for to go to Isaac his father unto the land of Canaan.
Genesis 31:19	Now Laban was gone to shear his sheep: and Rachel stole the teraphim that were her father’s.
Genesis 31:20	And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled.
Genesis 31:21	So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the River, and set his face toward the mountain of Gilead.
Genesis 31:22	And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.
Genesis 31:23	And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days’ journey; and he overtook him in the mountain of Gilead.
Genesis 31:24	And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream of the night, and said unto him, Take heed to thyself that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.
Genesis 31:25	And Laban came up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mountain of Gilead.
Genesis 31:26	And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters as captives of the sword?
Genesis 31:27	Wherefore didst thou flee secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth and with songs, with tabret and with harp;
Genesis 31:28	and hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? now hast thou done foolishly.
Genesis 31:29	It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take heed to thyself that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.
Genesis 31:30	And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father’s house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?
Genesis 31:31	And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Lest thou shouldest take thy daughters from me by force.
Genesis 31:32	With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, he shall not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.
Genesis 31:33	And Laban went into Jacob’s tent, and into Leah’s tent, and into the tent of the two maidservants; but he found them not. And he went out of Leah’s tent, and entered into Rachel’s tent.
Genesis 31:34	Now Rachel had taken the teraphim, and put them in the camel’s furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban felt about all the tent, but found them not.
Genesis 31:35	And she said to her father, Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise up before thee; for the manner of women is upon me. And he searched, but found not the teraphim.
Genesis 31:36	And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast hotly pursued after me?
Genesis 31:37	Whereas thou hast felt about all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? Set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us two.
Genesis 31:38	This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she-goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flocks have I not eaten.
Genesis 31:39	That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.
Genesis 31:40	Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep fled from mine eyes.
Genesis 31:41	These twenty years have I been in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy flock: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.
Genesis 31:42	Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the Fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely now hadst thou sent me away empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.
Genesis 31:43	And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, The daughters are my daughters, and the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have borne?
Genesis 31:44	And now come, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.
Genesis 31:45	And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.
Genesis 31:46	And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there by the heap.
Genesis 31:47	And Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.
Genesis 31:48	And Laban said, This heap is witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed:
Genesis 31:49	and Mizpah, for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another.
Genesis 31:50	If thou shalt afflict my daughters, and if thou shalt take wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee.
Genesis 31:51	And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold the pillar, which I have set betwixt me and thee.
Genesis 31:52	This heap be witness, and the pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.
Genesis 31:53	The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the Fear of his father Isaac.
Genesis 31:54	And Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mountain.
Genesis 31:55	And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place.
Genesis 32:1	And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.
Genesis 32:2	And Jacob said when he saw them, This is God’s host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.
Genesis 32:3	And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the field of Edom.
Genesis 32:4	And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye say unto my lord Esau; Thus saith thy servant Jacob, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed until now:
Genesis 32:5	and I have oxen, and asses and flocks, and menservants ard maidservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.
Genesis 32:6	And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and moreover he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.
Genesis 32:7	Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two companies;
Genesis 32:8	and he said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the company which is left shall escape.
Genesis 32:9	And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O LORD, which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will do thee good:
Genesis 32:10	I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two companies.
Genesis 32:11	Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he come and smite me, the mother with the children.
Genesis 32:12	And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.
Genesis 32:13	And he lodged there that night; and took of that which he had with him a present for Esau his brother;
Genesis 32:14	two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,
Genesis 32:15	thirty milch camels and their colts, forty kine and ten bulls, twenty she-asses and ten foals.
Genesis 32:16	And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.
Genesis 32:17	And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?
Genesis 32:18	then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob’s; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, he also is behind us.
Genesis 32:19	And he commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him;
Genesis 32:20	and ye shall say, Moreover, behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept me.
Genesis 32:21	So the present passed over before him: and he himself lodged that night in the company.
Genesis 32:22	And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two handmaids, and his eleven children, and passed over the ford of Jabbok.
Genesis 32:23	And he took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that he had.
Genesis 32:24	And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.
Genesis 32:25	And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob’s thigh was strained, as he wrestled with him.
Genesis 32:26	And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.
Genesis 32:27	And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.
Genesis 32:28	And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for thou hast striven with God and with men, and hast prevailed.
Genesis 32:29	And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.
Genesis 32:30	And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for, said he, I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.
Genesis 32:31	And the sun rose upon him as he passed over Penuel, and he halted upon his thigh.
Genesis 32:32	Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sinew of the hip which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob’s thigh in the sinew of the hip.
Genesis 33:1	And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.
Genesis 33:2	And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.
Genesis 33:3	And he himself passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.
Genesis 33:4	And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.
Genesis 33:5	And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are these with thee? And he said, The children which God hath graciously given thy servant.
Genesis 33:6	Then the handmaids came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.
Genesis 33:7	And Leah also and her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.
Genesis 33:8	And he said, What meanest thou by all this company which I met? And he said, To find grace in the sight of my lord.
Genesis 33:9	And Esau said, I have enough; my brother, let that thou hast be thine.
Genesis 33:10	And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: forasmuch as I have seen thy face, as one seeth the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me.
Genesis 33:11	Take, I pray thee, my gift that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it.
Genesis 33:12	And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.
Genesis 33:13	And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and that the flocks and herds with me give suck: and if they overdrive them one day, all the flocks will die.
Genesis 33:14	Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according to the pace of the cattle that is before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.
Genesis 33:15	And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord.
Genesis 33:16	So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.
Genesis 33:17	And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.
Genesis 33:18	And Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan-aram; and encamped before the city.
Genesis 33:19	And he bought the parcel of ground, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for an hundred pieces of money.
Genesis 33:20	And he erected there an altar, and called it El-elohe-Israel.
Genesis 34:1	And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.
Genesis 34:2	And Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her; and he took her, and lay with her, and humbled her.
Genesis 34:3	And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.
Genesis 34:4	And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife.
Genesis 34:5	Now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter; and his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they came.
Genesis 34:6	And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him.
Genesis 34:7	And the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob’s daughter; which thing ought not to be done.
Genesis 34:8	And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her unto him to wife.
Genesis 34:9	And make ye marriages with us; give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you.
Genesis 34:10	And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.
Genesis 34:11	And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.
Genesis 34:12	Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.
Genesis 34:13	And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father with guile, and spake, because he had defiled Dinah their sister,
Genesis 34:14	and said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us:
Genesis 34:15	Only on this condition will we consent unto you: if ye will be as we be, that every male of you be circumcised;
Genesis 34:16	then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.
Genesis 34:17	But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.
Genesis 34:18	And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor’s son.
Genesis 34:19	And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob’s daughter: and he was honoured above all the house of his father.
Genesis 34:20	And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,
Genesis 34:21	These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for, behold, the land is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.
Genesis 34:22	Only on this condition will the men consent unto us to dwell with us, to become one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised.
Genesis 34:23	Shall not their cattle and their substance and all their beasts be ours? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us.
Genesis 34:24	And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.
Genesis 34:25	And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city unawares, and slew all the males.
Genesis 34:26	And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem’s house, and went forth.
Genesis 34:27	The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister.
Genesis 34:28	They took their flocks and their herds and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field;
Genesis 34:29	and all their wealth, and all their little ones and their wives, took they captive and spoiled, even all that was in the house.
Genesis 34:30	And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me, to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and, I being few in number, they will gather themselves together against me and smite me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.
Genesis 34:31	And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?
Genesis 35:1	And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Beth-el, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, who appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.
Genesis 35:2	Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and purify yourselves, and change your garments:
Genesis 35:3	and let us arise, and go up to Beth-el; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.
Genesis 35:4	And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and the rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.
Genesis 35:5	And they journeyed: and a great terror was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.
Genesis 35:6	So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan (the same is Beth-el), he and all the people that were with him.
Genesis 35:7	And he built there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el: because there God was revealed unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother.
Genesis 35:8	And Deborah Rebekah’s nurse died, and she was buried below Beth-el under the oak: and the name of it was called Allon-bacuth.
Genesis 35:9	And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him.
Genesis 35:10	And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel.
Genesis 35:11	And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins;
Genesis 35:12	and the land which I gave unto Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.
Genesis 35:13	And God went up from him in the place where he spake with him.
Genesis 35:14	And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he spake with him, a pillar of stone: and he poured out a drink offering thereon, and poured oil thereon.
Genesis 35:15	And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Beth-el.
Genesis 35:16	And they journeyed from Beth-el; and there was still some way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.
Genesis 35:17	And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; for now thou shalt have another son.
Genesis 35:18	And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing (for she died), that she called his name Ben-oni: but his father called him Benjamin.
Genesis 35:19	And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath (the same is Beth-lehem).
Genesis 35:20	And Jacob set up a pillar upon her grave: the same is the Pillar of Rachel’s grave unto this day.
Genesis 35:21	And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Eder.
Genesis 35:22	And it came to pass, while Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father’s concubine: and Israel heard of it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:
Genesis 35:23	the sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:
Genesis 35:24	the sons of Rachel; Joseph and Benjamin:
Genesis 35:25	and the sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s handmaid; Dan and Naphtali:
Genesis 35:26	and the sons of Zilpah, Leah’s handmaid; Gad and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Paddan-aram.
Genesis 35:27	And Jacob came unto Isaac his father to Mamre, to Kiriath-arba (the same is Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.
Genesis 35:28	And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.
Genesis 35:29	And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, old and full of days: and Esau and Jacob his sons buried him.
Genesis 36:1	Now these are the generations of Esau (the same is Edom).
Genesis 36:2	Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;
Genesis 36:3	and Basemath Ishmael’s daughter, sister of Nebaioth.
Genesis 36:4	And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Basemath bare Reuel;
Genesis 36:5	and Oholibamah bare Jeush, and Jalam, and Korah: these are the sons of Esau, which were born unto him in the land of Canaan.
Genesis 36:6	And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the souls of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his possessions, which he had gathered in the land of Canaan; and went into a land away from his brother Jacob.
Genesis 36:7	For their substance was too great for them to dwell together; and the land of their sojournings could not bear them because of their cattle.
Genesis 36:8	And Esau dwelt in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.
Genesis 36:9	And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in mount Seir:

Genesis 36:22	And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan’s sister was Timna.
Genesis 36:23	And these are the children of Shobal; Alvan and Manahath and Ebal, Shepho and Onam.

Genesis 36:30	duke Dishon, duke Ezer, duke Dishan: these are the dukes that came of the Horites, according to their dukes in the land of Seir.
Genesis 36:31	And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the children of Israel.
Genesis 36:32	And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom; and the name of his city was Dinhabah.
Genesis 36:33	And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead.

Genesis 36:40	And these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau, according to their families, after their places, by their names; duke Timna, duke Alvah, duke Jetheth;
Genesis 36:41	duke Oholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon;
Genesis 36:42	duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar;
Genesis 36:43	duke Magdiel, duke Iram: these be the dukes of Edom, according to their habitations in the land of their possession. This is Esau the father of the Edomites.
Genesis 37:1	And Jacob dwelt in the land of his father’s sojournings, in the land of Canaan.
Genesis 37:2	These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and he was a lad with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father’s wives: and Joseph brought the evil report of them unto their father.
Genesis 37:3	Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours.
Genesis 37:4	And his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren; and they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.
Genesis 37:5	And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brethren: and they hated him yet the more.
Genesis 37:6	And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:
Genesis 37:7	for, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves came round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.
Genesis 37:8	And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.
Genesis 37:9	And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed yet a dream; and, behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars made obeisance to me.
Genesis 37:10	And he told it to his father, and to his brethren; and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?
Genesis 37:11	And his brethren envied him; but his father kept the saying in mind.
Genesis 37:12	And his brethren went to feed their father’s flock in Shechem.
Genesis 37:13	And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I.
Genesis 37:14	And he said to him, Go now, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flock; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.
Genesis 37:15	And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?
Genesis 37:16	And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they are feeding the flock.
Genesis 37:17	And the man said, They are departed hence: for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan.
Genesis 37:18	And they saw him afar off, and before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.
Genesis 37:19	And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.
Genesis 37:20	Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into one of the pits, and we will say, An evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams.
Genesis 37:21	And Reuben heard it, and delivered him out of their hand; and said, Let us not take his life.
Genesis 37:22	And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood; cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, but lay no hand upon him: that he might deliver him out of their hand, to restore him to his father.
Genesis 37:23	And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stript Joseph of his coat, the coat of many colours that was on him;
Genesis 37:24	and they took him, and cast him into the pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it.
Genesis 37:25	And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a travelling company of Ishmaelites came from Gilead, with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.
Genesis 37:26	And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood?
Genesis 37:27	Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother, our flesh. And his brethren hearkened unto him.
Genesis 37:28	And there passed by Midianites, merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. And they brought Joseph into Egypt.
Genesis 37:29	And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes.
Genesis 37:30	And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, whither shall I go?
Genesis 37:31	And they took Joseph’s coat, and killed a he-goat, and dipped the coat in the blood;
Genesis 37:32	and they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy son’s coat or not.
Genesis 37:33	And he knew it, and said, It is my son’s coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt torn in pieces.
Genesis 37:34	And Jacob rent his garments, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.
Genesis 37:35	And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down to the grave to my son mourning. And his father wept for him.
Genesis 37:36	And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh’s, the captain of the guard.
Genesis 38:1	And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.
Genesis 38:2	And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua; and he took her, and went in unto her.
Genesis 38:3	And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.
Genesis 38:4	And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan.
Genesis 38:5	And she yet again bare a son, and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.
Genesis 38:6	And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name was Tamar.
Genesis 38:7	And Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him.
Genesis 38:8	And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother’s wife, and perform the duty of an husband’s brother unto her, and raise up seed to thy brother.
Genesis 38:9	And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother’s wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest he should give seed to his brother.
Genesis 38:10	And the thing which he did was evil in the sight of the LORD: and he slew him also.
Genesis 38:11	Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow in thy father’s house, till Shelah my son be grown up: for he said, Lest he also die, like his brethren. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father’s house.
Genesis 38:12	And in process of time Shua’s daughter, the wife of Judah, died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.
Genesis 38:13	And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold, thy father in law goeth up to Timnah to shear his sheep.
Genesis 38:14	And she put off from her the garments of her widowhood, and covered herself with her veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in the gate of Enaim, which is by the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she was not given unto him to wife.
Genesis 38:15	When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; for she had covered her face.
Genesis 38:16	And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee: for he knew not that she was his daughter in law. And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?
Genesis 38:17	And he said, I will send thee a kid of the goats from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?
Genesis 38:18	And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet and thy cord, and thy staff that is in thine hand. And he gave them to her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.
Genesis 38:19	And she arose, and went away, and put off her veil from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.
Genesis 38:20	And Judah sent the kid of the goats by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman’s hand: but he found her not.
Genesis 38:21	Then he asked the men of her place, saying, Where is the harlot, that was at Enaim by the way side? And they said, There hath been no harlot here.
Genesis 38:22	And he returned to Judah, and said, I have not found her; and also the men of the place said, There hath been no harlot here.
Genesis 38:23	And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be put to shame: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.
Genesis 38:24	And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and moreover, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.
Genesis 38:25	When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and the cords, and the staff.
Genesis 38:26	And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She is more righteous than I; forasmuch as I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.
Genesis 38:27	And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb.
Genesis 38:28	And it came to pass, when she travailed, that one put out a hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.
Genesis 38:29	And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, Wherefore hast thou made a breach for thyself? therefore his name was called Perez.
Genesis 38:30	And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zerah.
Genesis 39:1	And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh’s, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hand of the Ishmaelites, which had brought him down thither.
Genesis 39:2	And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.
Genesis 39:3	And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand.
Genesis 39:4	And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he ministered unto him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.
Genesis 39:5	And it came to pass from the time that he made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had, in the house and in the field.
Genesis 39:6	And he left all that he had in Joseph’s hand; and he knew not aught that was with him, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was comely, and well favoured.
Genesis 39:7	And it came to pass after these things, that his master’s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.
Genesis 39:8	But he refused, and said unto his master’s wife, Behold, my master knoweth not what is with me in the house, and he hath put all that he hath into my hand;
Genesis 39:9	there is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?
Genesis 39:10	And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.
Genesis 39:11	And it came to pass about this time, that he went into the house to do his work; and there was none of the men of the house there within.
Genesis 39:12	And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.
Genesis 39:13	And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,
Genesis 39:14	that she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:
Genesis 39:15	and it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and fled, and got him out.
Genesis 39:16	And she laid up his garment by her, until his master came home.
Genesis 39:17	And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:
Genesis 39:18	and it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and fled out.
Genesis 39:19	And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.
Genesis 39:20	And Joseph’s master took him, and put him into the prison, the place where the king’s prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison.
Genesis 39:21	But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed kindness unto him, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.
Genesis 39:22	And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph’s hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it.
Genesis 39:23	The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand, because the LORD was with him; and that which he did, the LORD made it to prosper.
Genesis 40:1	And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker offended their lord the king of Egypt.
Genesis 40:2	And Pharaoh was wroth against his two officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.
Genesis 40:3	And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.
Genesis 40:4	And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he ministered unto them: and they continued a season in ward.
Genesis 40:5	And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream, in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the prison.
Genesis 40:6	And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and saw them, and, behold, they were sad.
Genesis 40:7	And he asked Pharaoh’s officers that were with him in ward in his master’s house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day?
Genesis 40:8	And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell it me, I pray you.
Genesis 40:9	And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;
Genesis 40:10	and in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, and its blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:
Genesis 40:11	and Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand.
Genesis 40:12	And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: the three branches are three days;
Genesis 40:13	within yet three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thine office: and thou shalt give Pharaoh’s cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.
Genesis 40:14	But have me in thy remembrance when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:
Genesis 40:15	for indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.
Genesis 40:16	When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, three baskets of white bread were on my head:
Genesis 40:17	and in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.
Genesis 40:18	And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: the three baskets are three days;
Genesis 40:19	within yet three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.
Genesis 40:20	And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and the head of the chief baker among his servants.
Genesis 40:21	And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand:
Genesis 40:22	but he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.
Genesis 40:23	Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.
Genesis 41:1	And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.
Genesis 41:2	And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, well favoured and fatfleshed; and they fed in the reed-grass.
Genesis 41:3	And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river.
Genesis 41:4	And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.
Genesis 41:5	And he slept and dreamed a second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.
Genesis 41:6	And, behold, seven ears, thin and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them.
Genesis 41:7	And the thin ears swallowed up the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.
Genesis 41:8	And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.
Genesis 41:9	Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:
Genesis 41:10	Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, me and the chief baker:
Genesis 41:11	and we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.
Genesis 41:12	And there was with us there a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.
Genesis 41:13	And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.
Genesis 41:14	Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.
Genesis 41:15	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that when thou hearest a dream thou canst interpret it.
Genesis 41:16	And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.
Genesis 41:17	And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the brink of the river:
Genesis 41:18	and, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in the reed-grass:
Genesis 41:19	and, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:
Genesis 41:20	and the lean and ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:
Genesis 41:21	and when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.
Genesis 41:22	And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up upon one stalk, full and good:
Genesis 41:23	and, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:
Genesis 41:24	and the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears: and I told it unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.
Genesis 41:25	And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: what God is about to do he hath declared unto Pharaoh.
Genesis 41:26	The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one.
Genesis 41:27	And the seven lean and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven years, and also the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind; they shall be seven years of famine.
Genesis 41:28	That is the thing which I spake unto Pharaoh: what God is about to do he hath shewed unto Pharaoh.
Genesis 41:29	Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:
Genesis 41:30	and there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;
Genesis 41:31	and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine which followeth; for it shall be very grievous.
Genesis 41:32	And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice, it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.
Genesis 41:33	Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.
Genesis 41:34	Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint overseers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.
Genesis 41:35	And let them gather all the food of these good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it.
Genesis 41:36	And the food shall be for a store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.
Genesis 41:37	And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.
Genesis 41:38	And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom the spirit of God is?
Genesis 41:39	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou:
Genesis 41:40	thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.
Genesis 41:41	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.
Genesis 41:42	And Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph’s hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;
Genesis 41:43	and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he set him over all the land of Egypt.
Genesis 41:44	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt.
Genesis 41:45	And Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphenath-paneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On. And Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.
Genesis 41:46	And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.
Genesis 41:47	And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.
Genesis 41:48	And he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.
Genesis 41:49	And Joseph laid up corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for it was without number.
Genesis 41:50	And unto Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On bare unto him.
Genesis 41:51	And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For, said he, God hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father’s house.
Genesis 41:52	And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.
Genesis 41:53	And the seven years of plenty, that was in the land of Egypt, came to an end.
Genesis 41:54	And the seven years of famine began to come, according as Joseph had said: and there was famine in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.
Genesis 41:55	And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.
Genesis 41:56	And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine was sore in the land of Egypt.
Genesis 41:57	And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; because the famine was sore in all the earth.
Genesis 42:1	Now Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, and Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?
Genesis 42:2	And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.
Genesis 42:3	And Joseph’s ten brethren went down to buy corn from Egypt.
Genesis 42:4	But Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.
Genesis 42:5	And the sons of Israel came to buy among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
Genesis 42:6	And Joseph was the governor over the land; he it was that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph’s brethren came, and bowed down themselves to him with their faces to the earth.
Genesis 42:7	And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly with them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.
Genesis 42:8	And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.
Genesis 42:9	And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.
Genesis 42:10	And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come.
Genesis 42:11	We are all one man’s sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies.
Genesis 42:12	And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.
Genesis 42:13	And they said, We thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not.
Genesis 42:14	And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are spies:
Genesis 42:15	hereby ye shall be proved: by the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.
Genesis 42:16	Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be bound, that your words may be proved, whether there be truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies.
Genesis 42:17	And he put them all together into ward three days.
Genesis 42:18	And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God:
Genesis 42:19	if ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in your prison house; but go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses:
Genesis 42:20	and bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.
Genesis 42:21	And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.
Genesis 42:22	And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore also, behold, his blood is required.
Genesis 42:23	And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for there was an interpreter between them.
Genesis 42:24	And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and he returned to them, and spake to them, and took Simeon from among them, and bound him before their eyes.
Genesis 42:25	Then Joseph commanded to fill their vessels with corn, and to restore every man’s money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus was it done unto them.
Genesis 42:26	And they laded their asses with their corn, and departed thence.
Genesis 42:27	And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the lodging place, he espied his money; and, behold, it was in the mouth of his sack.
Genesis 42:28	And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they turned trembling one to another, saying, What is this that God hath done unto us?
Genesis 42:29	And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that had befallen them; saying,
Genesis 42:30	The man, the lord of the land, spake roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country.
Genesis 42:31	And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies:
Genesis 42:32	we be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.
Genesis 42:33	And the man, the lord of the land, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren with me, and take corn for the famine of your houses, and go your way:
Genesis 42:34	and bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.
Genesis 42:35	And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man’s bundle of money was in his sack: and when they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid.
Genesis 42:36	And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me.
Genesis 42:37	And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.
Genesis 42:38	And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he only is left: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.
Genesis 43:1	And the famine was sore in the land.
Genesis 43:2	And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food.
Genesis 43:3	And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.
Genesis 43:4	If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:
Genesis 43:5	but if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.
Genesis 43:6	And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?
Genesis 43:7	And they said, The man asked straitly concerning ourselves, and concerning our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we in any wise know that he would say, Bring your brother down?
Genesis 43:8	And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones.
Genesis 43:9	I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:
Genesis 43:10	for except we had lingered, surely we had now returned a second time.
Genesis 43:11	And their father Israel said unto them, If it be so now, do this; take of the choice fruits of the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spicery and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:
Genesis 43:12	and take double money in your hand; and the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks carry again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight:
Genesis 43:13	take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:
Genesis 43:14	and God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may release unto you your other brother and Benjamin. And if I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.
Genesis 43:15	And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.
Genesis 43:16	And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, Bring the men into the house, and slay, and make ready; for the men shall dine with me at noon.
Genesis 43:17	And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph’s house.
Genesis 43:18	And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph’s house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.
Genesis 43:19	And they came near to the steward of Joseph’s house, and they spake unto him at the door of the house,
Genesis 43:20	and said, Oh my lord, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:
Genesis 43:21	and it came to pass, when we came to the lodging place, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man’s money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.
Genesis 43:22	And other money have we brought down in our hand to buy food: we know not who put our money in our sacks.
Genesis 43:23	And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.
Genesis 43:24	And the man brought the men into Joseph’s house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.
Genesis 43:25	And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.
Genesis 43:26	And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed down themselves to him to the earth.
Genesis 43:27	And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?
Genesis 43:28	And they said, Thy servant our father is well, he is yet alive. And they bowed the head, and made obeisance.
Genesis 43:29	And he lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin his brother, his mother’s son, and said, Is this your youngest brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.
Genesis 43:30	And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there.
Genesis 43:31	And he washed his face, and came out; and he refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.
Genesis 43:32	And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.
Genesis 43:33	And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marveled one with another.
Genesis 43:34	And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin’s mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.
Genesis 44:1	And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men’s sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man’s money in his sack’s mouth.
Genesis 44:2	And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack’s mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.
Genesis 44:3	As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.
Genesis 44:4	And when they were gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?
Genesis 44:5	Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby he indeed divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.
Genesis 44:6	And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these words.
Genesis 44:7	And they said unto him, Wherefore speaketh my lord such words as these? God forbid that thy servants should do such a thing.
Genesis 44:8	Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks’ mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord’s house silver or gold?
Genesis 44:9	With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, let him die, and we also will be my lord’s bondmen.
Genesis 44:10	And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my bondman; and ye shall be blameless.
Genesis 44:11	Then they hasted, and took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.
Genesis 44:12	And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.
Genesis 44:13	Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.
Genesis 44:14	And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph’s house; and he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.
Genesis 44:15	And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? know ye not that such a man as I can indeed divine?
Genesis 44:16	And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord’s bondmen, both we, and he also in whose hand the cup is found.
Genesis 44:17	And he said, God forbid that I should do so: the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my bondman; but as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.
Genesis 44:18	Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord’s ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh.
Genesis 44:19	My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?
Genesis 44:20	And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.
Genesis 44:21	And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.
Genesis 44:22	And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die.
Genesis 44:23	And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.
Genesis 44:24	And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.
Genesis 44:25	And our father said, Go again, buy us a little food.
Genesis 44:26	And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man’s face, except our youngest brother be with us.
Genesis 44:27	And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons:
Genesis 44:28	and the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I have not seen him since:
Genesis 44:29	and if ye take this one also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.
Genesis 44:30	Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad’s life;
Genesis 44:31	it shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.
Genesis 44:32	For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then shall I bear the blame to my father for ever.
Genesis 44:33	Now therefore, let thy servant, I pray thee, abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.
Genesis 44:34	For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest I see the evil that shall come on my father.
Genesis 45:1	Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren.
Genesis 45:2	And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard.
Genesis 45:3	And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.
Genesis 45:4	And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.
Genesis 45:5	And now be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.
Genesis 45:6	For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and there are yet five years, in the which there shall be neither plowing nor harvest.
Genesis 45:7	And God sent me before you to preserve you a remnant in the earth, and to save you alive by a great deliverance.
Genesis 45:8	So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt.
Genesis 45:9	Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not:
Genesis 45:10	and thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children’s children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast:
Genesis 45:11	and there will I nourish thee; for there are yet five years of famine; lest thou come to poverty, thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast.
Genesis 45:12	And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.
Genesis 45:13	And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.
Genesis 45:14	And he fell upon his brother Benjamin’s neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck.
Genesis 45:15	And he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him.
Genesis 45:16	And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh’s house, saying, Joseph’s brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.
Genesis 45:17	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;
Genesis 45:18	and take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.
Genesis 45:19	Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.
Genesis 45:20	Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.
Genesis 45:21	And the sons of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.
Genesis 45:22	To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment.
Genesis 45:23	And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she-asses laden with corn and bread and victual for his father by the way.
Genesis 45:24	So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.
Genesis 45:25	And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father.
Genesis 45:26	And they told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt. And his heart fainted, for he believed them not.
Genesis 45:27	And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:
Genesis 45:28	and Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.
Genesis 46:1	And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beer-sheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.
Genesis 46:2	And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.
Genesis 46:3	And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation:
Genesis 46:4	I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.
Genesis 46:5	And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.
Genesis 46:6	And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him:
Genesis 46:7	his sons, and his sons’ sons with him, his daughters, and his sons’ daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.
Genesis 46:8	And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn.
Genesis 46:9	And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Pallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.
Genesis 46:10	And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.
Genesis 46:11	And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
Genesis 46:12	And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Perez, and Zerah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul.
Genesis 46:13	And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Puvah, and Iob, and Shimron.
Genesis 46:14	And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.
Genesis 46:15	These are the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in Paddan-aram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three.
Genesis 46:16	And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli.
Genesis 46:17	And the sons of Asher; Imnah, and Ishvah, and Ishvi, and Beriah, and Serah their sister: and the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel.
Genesis 46:18	These are the sons of Zilpah, which Laban gave to Leah his daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls.
Genesis 46:19	The sons of Rachel Jacob’s wife; Joseph and Benjamin.
Genesis 46:20	And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, which Asenath the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On bare unto him.
Genesis 46:21	And the sons of Benjamin; Bela, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.
Genesis 46:22	These are the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all the souls were fourteen.
Genesis 46:23	And the sons of Dan; Hushim.
Genesis 46:24	And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem.
Genesis 46:25	These are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob: all the souls were seven.
Genesis 46:26	All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his loins, besides Jacob’s sons’ wives, all the souls were threescore and six;
Genesis 46:27	and the sons of Joseph, which were born to him in Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were threescore and ten.
Genesis 46:28	And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to shew the way before him unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.
Genesis 46:29	And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen; and he presented himself unto him, and fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.
Genesis 46:30	And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, that thou art yet alive.
Genesis 46:31	And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father’s house, I will go up, and tell Pharaoh, and will say unto him, My brethren, and my father’s house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;
Genesis 46:32	and the men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.
Genesis 46:33	And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation?
Genesis 46:34	that ye shall say, Thy servants have been keepers of cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians.
Genesis 47:1	Then Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen.
Genesis 47:2	And from among his brethren he took five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh.
Genesis 47:3	And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and our fathers.
Genesis 47:4	And they said unto Pharaoh, To sojourn in the land are we come; for there is no pasture for thy servants’ flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.
Genesis 47:5	And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee:
Genesis 47:6	the land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and thy brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest any able men among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.
Genesis 47:7	And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
Genesis 47:8	And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How many are the days of the years of thy life?
Genesis 47:9	And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.
Genesis 47:10	And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of Pharaoh.
Genesis 47:11	And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.
Genesis 47:12	And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father’s household, with bread, according to their families.
Genesis 47:13	And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.
Genesis 47:14	And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s house.
Genesis 47:15	And when the money was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for our money faileth.
Genesis 47:16	And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail.
Genesis 47:17	And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses, and for the flocks, and for the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread in exchange for all their cattle for that year.
Genesis 47:18	And when that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide from my lord, how that our money is all spent; and the herds of cattle are my lord’s; there is nought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:
Genesis 47:19	wherefore should we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, and that the land be not desolate.
Genesis 47:20	So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine was sore upon them: and the land became Pharaoh’s.
Genesis 47:21	And as for the people, he removed them to the cities from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end thereof.
Genesis 47:22	Only the land of the priests bought he not: for the priests had a portion from Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them; wherefore they sold not their land.
Genesis 47:23	Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land.
Genesis 47:24	And it shall come to pass at the ingatherings, that ye shall give a fifth unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.
Genesis 47:25	And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh’s servants.
Genesis 47:26	And Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt unto this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth; only the land of the priests alone became not Pharaoh’s.
Genesis 47:27	And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they gat them possessions therein, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly.
Genesis 47:28	And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were an hundred forty and seven years.
Genesis 47:29	And the time drew near that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt:
Genesis 47:30	but when I sleep with my fathers, thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.
Genesis 47:31	And he said, Swear unto me: and he sware unto him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed’s head.
Genesis 48:1	And it came to pass after these things, that one said to Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.
Genesis 48:2	And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.
Genesis 48:3	And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,
Genesis 48:4	and said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a company of peoples; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.
Genesis 48:5	And now thy two sons, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simeon, shall be mine.
Genesis 48:6	And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine; they shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.
Genesis 48:7	And as for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when there was still some way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way to Ephrath (the same is Beth-lehem).
Genesis 48:8	And Israel beheld Joseph’s sons, and said, Who are these?
Genesis 48:9	And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me here. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.
Genesis 48:10	Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.
Genesis 48:11	And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath let me see thy seed also.
Genesis 48:12	And Joseph brought them out from between his knees; and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.
Genesis 48:13	And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel’s right hand, and brought them near unto him.
Genesis 48:14	And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim’s head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh’s head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.
Genesis 48:15	And he blessed Joseph, and said, The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which hath fed me all my life long unto this day,
Genesis 48:16	the angel which hath redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.
Genesis 48:17	And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father’s hand, to remove it from Ephraim’s head unto Manasseh’s head.
Genesis 48:18	And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.
Genesis 48:19	And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: howbeit his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.
Genesis 48:20	And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.
Genesis 48:21	And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.
Genesis 48:22	Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.
Genesis 49:1	And Jacob called unto his sons, and said: Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the latter days.
Genesis 49:2	Assemble yourselves, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; And hearken unto Israel your father.
Genesis 49:3	Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength; The excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power.
Genesis 49:4	Unstable as water, thou shalt not have the excellency; Because thou wentest up to thy father’s bed: Then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch.
Genesis 49:5	Simeon and Levi are brethren; Weapons of violence are their swords.
Genesis 49:6	O my soul, come not thou into their council; Unto their assembly, my glory, be not thou united; For in their anger they slew a man, And in their selfwill they houghed an ox.
Genesis 49:7	Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; And their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, And scatter them in Israel.
Genesis 49:8	Judah, thee shall thy brethren praise: Thy hand shall be on the neck of thine enemies; Thy father’s sons shall bow down before thee.
Genesis 49:9	Judah is a lion’s whelp; From the prey, my son, thou art gone up: He stooped down, he couched as a lion, And as a lioness; who shall rouse him up?
Genesis 49:10	The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, Nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet, Until Shiloh come; And unto him shall the obedience of the peoples be.
Genesis 49:11	Binding his foal unto the vine, And his ass’s colt unto the choice vine; He hath washed his garments in wine, And his vesture in the blood of grapes:
Genesis 49:12	His eyes shall be red with wine, And his teeth white with milk.
Genesis 49:13	Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea: And he shall be for an haven of ships; And his border shall be upon Zidon.
Genesis 49:14	Issachar is a strong ass, Couching down between the sheepfolds:
Genesis 49:15	And he saw a resting place that it was good, And the land that it was pleasant; And he bowed his shoulder to bear, And became a servant under taskwork.
Genesis 49:16	Dan shall judge his people, As one of the tribes of Israel.
Genesis 49:17	Dan shall be a serpent in the way, An adder in the path, That biteth the horse’s heels, So that his rider falleth backward.
Genesis 49:18	I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.
Genesis 49:19	Gad, a troop shall press upon him: But he shall press upon their heel.
Genesis 49:20	Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, And he shall yield royal dainties.
Genesis 49:21	Naphtali is a hind let loose: He giveth goodly words.
Genesis 49:22	Joseph is a fruitful bough, A fruitful bough by a fountain; His branches run over the wall.
Genesis 49:23	The archers have sorely grieved him, And shot at him, and persecuted him:
Genesis 49:24	But his bow abode in strength, And the arms of his hands were made strong, By the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob, (From thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel,)
Genesis 49:25	Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee, And by the Almighty, who shall bless thee, With blessings of heaven above, Blessings of the deep that coucheth beneath, Blessings of the breasts, and of the womb.
Genesis 49:26	The blessings of thy father Have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors Unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: They shall be on the head of Joseph, And on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.
Genesis 49:27	Benjamin is a wolf that ravineth: In the morning he shall devour the prey, And at even he shall divide the spoil.
Genesis 49:28	All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their father spake unto them and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.
Genesis 49:29	And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,
Genesis 49:30	in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace:
Genesis 49:31	there they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah:
Genesis 49:32	the field and the cave that is therein, which was purchased from the children of Heth.
Genesis 49:33	And when Jacob made an end of charging his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people.
Genesis 50:1	And Joseph fell upon his father’s face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.
Genesis 50:2	And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.
Genesis 50:3	And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of embalming: and the Egyptians wept for him threescore and ten days.
Genesis 50:4	And when the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,
Genesis 50:5	My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.
Genesis 50:6	And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.
Genesis 50:7	And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,
Genesis 50:8	and all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father’s house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.
Genesis 50:9	And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.
Genesis 50:10	And they came to the threshing-floor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they lamented with a very great and sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.
Genesis 50:11	And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abel-mizraim, which is beyond Jordan.
Genesis 50:12	And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:
Genesis 50:13	for his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field, for a possession of a buryingplace, of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.
Genesis 50:14	And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.
Genesis 50:15	And when Joseph’s brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, It may be that Joseph will hate us, and will fully requite us all the evil which we did unto him.
Genesis 50:16	And they sent a message unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,
Genesis 50:17	So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the transgression of thy brethren, and their sin, for that they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.
Genesis 50:18	And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we be thy servants.
Genesis 50:19	And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?
Genesis 50:20	And as for you, ye meant evil against me; but God meant it for good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.
Genesis 50:21	Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.
Genesis 50:22	And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father’s house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.
Genesis 50:23	And Joseph saw Ephraim’s children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were born upon Joseph’s knees.
Genesis 50:24	And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: but God will surely visit you, and bring you up out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
Genesis 50:25	And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.
Genesis 50:26	So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.
Exodus 1:1	Now these are the names of the sons of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.
Exodus 1:2	Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah;
Exodus 1:3	Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin;
Exodus 1:4	Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.
Exodus 1:5	And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: and Joseph was in Egypt already.
Exodus 1:6	And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.
Exodus 1:7	And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.
Exodus 1:8	Now there arose a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.
Exodus 1:9	And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we:
Exodus 1:10	come, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they also join themselves unto our enemies, and fight against us, and get them up out of the land.
Exodus 1:11	Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh store cities, Pithom and Raamses.
Exodus 1:12	But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and the more they spread abroad. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.
Exodus 1:13	And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour:
Exodus 1:14	and they made their lives bitter with hard service, in mortar and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field, all their service, wherein they made them serve with rigour.
Exodus 1:15	And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:
Exodus 1:16	and he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the birthstool; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him; but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.
Exodus 1:17	But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.
Exodus 1:18	And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?
Exodus 1:19	And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwife come unto them.
Exodus 1:20	And God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.
Exodus 1:21	And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.
Exodus 1:22	And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.
Exodus 2:1	And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi.
Exodus 2:2	And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.
Exodus 2:3	And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch; and she put the child therein, and laid it in the flags by the river’s brink.
Exodus 2:4	And his sister stood afar off, to know what would be done to him.
Exodus 2:5	And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river side; and she saw the ark among the flags, and sent her handmaid to fetch it.
Exodus 2:6	And she opened it, and saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews’ children.
Exodus 2:7	Then said his sister to Pharaoh’s daughter, Shall I go and call thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?
Exodus 2:8	And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child’s mother.
Exodus 2:9	And Pharaoh’s daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it.
Exodus 2:10	And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses, and said, Because I drew him out of the water.
Exodus 2:11	And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown up, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he saw an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.
Exodus 2:12	And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he smote the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.
Exodus 2:13	And he went out the second day, and, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?
Exodus 2:14	And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? thinkest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely the thing is known.
Exodus 2:15	Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.
Exodus 2:16	Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock.
Exodus 2:17	And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.
Exodus 2:18	And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon today?
Exodus 2:19	And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover he drew water for us, and watered the flock.
Exodus 2:20	And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.
Exodus 2:21	And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.
Exodus 2:22	And she bare a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a sojourner in a strange land.
Exodus 2:23	And it came to pass in the course of those many days, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.
Exodus 2:24	And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.
Exodus 2:25	And God saw the children of Israel, and God took knowledge of them.
Exodus 3:1	Now Moses was keeping the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the back of the wilderness, and came to the mountain of God, unto Horeb.
Exodus 3:2	And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.
Exodus 3:3	And Moses said, I will turn aside now, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.
Exodus 3:4	And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.
Exodus 3:5	And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.
Exodus 3:6	Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.
Exodus 3:7	And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;
Exodus 3:8	and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.
Exodus 3:9	And now, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: moreover I have seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.
Exodus 3:10	Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.
Exodus 3:11	And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?
Exodus 3:12	And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be the token unto thee, that I have sent thee: when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.
Exodus 3:13	And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them?
Exodus 3:14	And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.
Exodus 3:15	And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, The LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.

Exodus 5:7	Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.
Exodus 5:8	And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish aught thereof: for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.

Exodus 8:9	And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Have thou this glory over me: against what time shall I entreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, that the frogs be destroyed from thee and thy houses, and remain in the river only?
Exodus 8:10	And he said, Against tomorrow. And he said, Be it according to thy word: that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the LORD our God.

Exodus 8:18	And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: and there were lice upon man, and upon beast.

Exodus 8:20	And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
Exodus 8:21	Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are.
Exodus 8:22	And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth.
Exodus 8:23	And I will put a division between my people and thy people: by tomorrow shall this sign be.

Exodus 8:29	And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will entreat the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, tomorrow: only let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD.
Exodus 8:30	And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and entreated the LORD.
Exodus 8:31	And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one.
Exodus 8:32	And Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and he did not let the people go.
Exodus 9:1	Then the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
Exodus 9:2	For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still,
Exodus 9:3	behold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which is in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the herds, and upon the flocks: there shall be a very grievous murrain.
Exodus 9:4	And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all that belongeth to the children of Israel.
Exodus 9:5	And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, Tomorrow the LORD shall do this thing in the land.
Exodus 9:6	And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.
Exodus 9:7	And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not so much as one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was stubborn, and he did not let the people go.
Exodus 9:8	And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.

Exodus 9:10	And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast.
Exodus 9:11	And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boils were upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.
Exodus 9:12	And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses.
Exodus 9:13	And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
Exodus 9:14	For I will this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth.
Exodus 9:15	For now I had put forth my hand, and smitten thee and thy people with pestilence, and thou hadst been cut off from the earth:
Exodus 9:16	but in very deed for this cause have I made thee to stand, for to shew thee my power, and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.
Exodus 9:17	As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go?
Exodus 9:18	Behold, tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the day it was founded even until now.
Exodus 9:19	Now therefore send, hasten in thy cattle and all that thou hast in the field; for every man and beast which shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die.
Exodus 9:20	He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses:
Exodus 9:21	and he that regarded not the word of the LORD left his servants and his cattle in the field.
Exodus 9:22	And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.
Exodus 9:23	And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and fire ran down unto the earth; and the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt.
Exodus 9:24	So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.
Exodus 9:25	And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field.
Exodus 9:26	Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was there no hail.
Exodus 9:27	And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I have sinned this time: the LORD is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.
Exodus 9:28	Entreat the LORD; for there hath been enough of these mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer.
Exodus 9:29	And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto the LORD; the thunders shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know that the earth is the LORD’S.
Exodus 9:30	But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the LORD God.
Exodus 9:31	And the flax and the barley were smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was bolled.
Exodus 9:32	But the wheat and the spelt were not smitten: for they were not grown up.
Exodus 9:33	And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands unto the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth.
Exodus 9:34	And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.
Exodus 9:35	And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the children of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses.

Exodus 10:2	and that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son’s son, what things I have wrought upon Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know that I am the LORD.
Exodus 10:3	And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.
Exodus 10:4	Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, tomorrow will I bring locusts into thy border:
Exodus 10:5	and they shall cover the face of the earth, that one shall not be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field:
Exodus 10:6	and thy houses shall be filled, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; as neither thy fathers nor thy fathers’ fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned, and went out from Pharaoh.
Exodus 10:7	And Pharaoh’s servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?
Exodus 10:8	And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go, serve the LORD your God; but who are they that shall go?
Exodus 10:9	And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast unto the LORD.
Exodus 10:10	And he said unto them, So be the LORD with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you.
Exodus 10:11	Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the LORD; for that is what ye desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh’s presence.
Exodus 10:12	And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left.
Exodus 10:13	And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all the night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.
Exodus 10:14	And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the borders of Egypt; very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.
Exodus 10:15	For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing, either tree or herb of the field, through all the land of Egypt.
Exodus 10:16	Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.
Exodus 10:17	Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and entreat the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this death only.
Exodus 10:18	And he went out from Pharaoh, and entreated the LORD.
Exodus 10:19	And the LORD turned an exceeding strong west wind, which took up the locusts, and drove them into the Red Sea; there remained not one locust in all the border of Egypt.

Exodus 10:21	And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.
Exodus 10:22	And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days;
Exodus 10:23	they saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.

Exodus 10:27	But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not let them go.
Exodus 10:28	And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in the day thou seest my face thou shalt die.
Exodus 10:29	And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well; I will see thy face again no more.
Exodus 11:1	And the LORD said unto Moses, Yet one plague more will I bring upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether.
Exodus 11:2	Speak now in the ears of the people, and let them ask every man of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold.

Exodus 12:1	And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,

Exodus 12:3	Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to their fathers’ houses, a lamb for an household:
Exodus 12:4	and if the household be too little for a lamb, then shall he and his neighbour next unto his house take one according to the number of the souls; according to every man’s eating ye shall make your count for the lamb.
Exodus 12:5	Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall take it from the sheep, or from the goats:
Exodus 12:6	and ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it at even.
Exodus 12:7	And they shall take of the blood, and put it on the two side posts and on the lintel, upon the houses wherein they shall eat it.
Exodus 12:8	And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; with bitter herbs they shall eat it.
Exodus 12:9	Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with fire; its head with its legs and with the inwards thereof.
Exodus 12:10	And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; but that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.
Exodus 12:11	And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand: and ye shall eat it in haste: it is the LORD’S passover,
Exodus 12:12	For I will go through the land of Egypt in that night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am the LORD.

Exodus 12:15	Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.
Exodus 12:16	And in the first day there shall be to you an holy convocation, and in the seventh day an holy convocation; no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done of you.

Exodus 12:23	For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you.
Exodus 12:24	And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever.

Exodus 12:37	And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children.
Exodus 12:38	And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle.
Exodus 12:39	And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual.
Exodus 12:40	Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, which they sojourned in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.

Exodus 12:44	but every man’s servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.
Exodus 12:45	A sojourner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.
Exodus 12:46	In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth aught of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof.

Exodus 12:48	And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: but no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.

Exodus 13:11	And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanite, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it thee,
Exodus 13:12	that thou shalt set apart unto the LORD all that openeth the womb, and every firstling which thou hast that cometh of a beast; the males shall be the LORD’S.
Exodus 13:13	And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break its neck: and all the firstborn of man among thy sons shalt thou redeem.
Exodus 13:14	And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage:
Exodus 13:15	and it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all that openeth the womb, being males; but all the firstborn of my sons I redeem.
Exodus 13:16	And it shall be for a sign upon thine hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt.
Exodus 13:17	And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not by the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt:
Exodus 13:18	but God led the people about, by the way of the wilderness by the Red Sea: and the children of Israel went up armed out of the land of Egypt.
Exodus 13:19	And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.
Exodus 13:20	And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.
Exodus 13:21	And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; that they might go by day and by night:

Exodus 14:1	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

Exodus 14:5	And it was told the king of Egypt that the people were fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was changed towards the people, and they said, What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us?
Exodus 14:6	And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:
Exodus 14:7	and he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over all of them.

Exodus 14:11	And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to bring us forth out of Egypt?
Exodus 14:12	Is not this the word that we spake unto thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it were better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.
Exodus 14:13	And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will work for you today: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen today, ye shall see them again no more for ever.

Exodus 15:10	Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: They sank as lead in the mighty waters.
Exodus 15:11	Who is like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? Who is like thee, glorious in holiness, Fearful in praises, doing wonders?

Exodus 16:2	And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron in the wilderness:
Exodus 16:3	and the children of Israel said unto them, Would that we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.

Exodus 16:8	And Moses said, This shall be, when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against the LORD.

Exodus 16:16	This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather ye of it every man according to his eating; an omer a head, according to the number of your persons, shall ye take it, every man for them which are in his tent.
Exodus 16:17	And the children of Israel did so, and gathered some more, some less.
Exodus 16:18	And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating.
Exodus 16:19	And Moses said unto them, Let no man leave of it till the morning.
Exodus 16:20	Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with them.
Exodus 16:21	And they gathered it morning by morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.
Exodus 16:22	And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.
Exodus 16:23	And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath spoken, Tomorrow is a solemn rest, a holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake that which ye will bake, and seethe that which ye will seethe; and all that remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.
Exodus 16:24	And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein.
Exodus 16:25	And Moses said, Eat that today; for today is a sabbath unto the LORD: today ye shall not find it in the field.
Exodus 16:26	Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day is the sabbath, in it there shall be none.
Exodus 16:27	And it came to pass on the seventh day, that there went out some of the people for to gather, and they found none.
Exodus 16:28	And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws?
Exodus 16:29	See, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.
Exodus 16:30	So the people rested on the seventh day.
Exodus 16:31	And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.
Exodus 16:32	And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Let an omerful of it be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread wherewith I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.
Exodus 16:33	And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omerful of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations.
Exodus 16:34	As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.
Exodus 16:35	And the children of Israel did eat the manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat the manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan.
Exodus 16:36	Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.
Exodus 17:1	And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, by their journeys, according to the commandment of the LORD, and pitched in Rephidim: and there was no water for the people to drink.
Exodus 17:2	Wherefore the people strove with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why strive ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD?
Exodus 17:3	And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore hast thou brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?
Exodus 17:4	And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto this people? they be almost ready to stone me.
Exodus 17:5	And the LORD said unto Moses, Pass on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go.
Exodus 17:6	Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.
Exodus 17:7	And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the striving of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?
Exodus 17:8	Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.
Exodus 17:9	And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand.
Exodus 17:10	So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.
Exodus 17:11	And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.
Exodus 17:12	But Moses’ hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.
Exodus 17:13	And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.
Exodus 17:14	And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: that I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.
Exodus 17:15	And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovah-nissi:
Exodus 17:16	and he said, The LORD hath sworn: the LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.
Exodus 18:1	Now Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father in law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, how that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt.
Exodus 18:2	And Jethro, Moses’ father in law, took Zipporah, Moses’ wife, after he had sent her away,
Exodus 18:3	and her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; for he said, I have been a sojourner in a strange land:
Exodus 18:4	and the name of the other was Eliezer; for he said, The God of my father was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh:
Exodus 18:5	and Jethro, Moses’ father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness where he was encamped, at the mount of God:
Exodus 18:6	and he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.
Exodus 18:7	And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent.
Exodus 18:8	And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how the LORD delivered them.
Exodus 18:9	And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians.
Exodus 18:10	And Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh; who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.
Exodus 18:11	Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: yea, in the thing wherein they dealt proudly against them.
Exodus 18:12	And Jethro, Moses’ father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses’ father in law before God.
Exodus 18:13	And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood about Moses from the morning unto the evening.
Exodus 18:14	And when Moses’ father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand about thee from morning unto even?
Exodus 18:15	And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me to inquire of God:
Exodus 18:16	when they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between a man and his neighbour, and I make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.
Exodus 18:17	And Moses’ father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good.
Exodus 18:18	Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee: for the thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.
Exodus 18:19	Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God be with thee: be thou for the people to God-ward, and bring thou the causes unto God:
Exodus 18:20	and thou shalt teach them the statutes and the laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.
Exodus 18:21	Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating unjust gain; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:
Exodus 18:22	and let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge themselves: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.
Exodus 18:23	If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people also shall go to their place in peace.
Exodus 18:24	So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said.
Exodus 18:25	And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.
Exodus 18:26	And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.
Exodus 18:27	And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land.
Exodus 19:1	In the third month after the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai.
Exodus 19:2	And when they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the wilderness of Sinai, they pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped before the mount.
Exodus 19:3	And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel;
Exodus 19:4	Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles’ wings, and brought you unto myself.
Exodus 19:5	Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me from among all peoples: for all the earth is mine:
Exodus 19:6	and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.
Exodus 19:7	And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which the LORD commanded him.
Exodus 19:8	And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD hath spoken we will do. And Moses reported the words of the people unto the LORD.
Exodus 19:9	And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and may also believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD.
Exodus 19:10	And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments,
Exodus 19:11	and be ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.
Exodus 19:12	And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death:
Exodus 19:13	no hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.
Exodus 19:14	And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their garments.
Exodus 19:15	And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not near a woman.
Exodus 19:16	And it came to pass on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of a trumpet exceeding loud; and all the people that were in the camp trembled.
Exodus 19:17	And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.
Exodus 19:18	And mount Sinai was altogether on smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.
Exodus 19:19	And when the voice of the trumpet waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.
Exodus 19:20	And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, to the top of the mount: and the LORD called Moses to the top of the mount; and Moses went up.
Exodus 19:21	And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.
Exodus 19:22	And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them.
Exodus 19:23	And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou didst charge us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.
Exodus 19:24	And the LORD said unto him, Go, get thee down; and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forth upon them.
Exodus 19:25	So Moses went down unto the people, and told them.
Exodus 20:1	And God spake all these words, saying,
Exodus 20:2	I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
Exodus 20:3	Thou shalt have none other gods before me.
Exodus 20:4	Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image, nor the likeness of any form that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:
Exodus 20:5	thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, upon the third and upon the fourth generation of them that hate me;
Exodus 20:6	and shewing mercy unto thousands, of them that love me and keep my commandments.
Exodus 20:7	Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.
Exodus 20:8	Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.
Exodus 20:9	Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:
Exodus 20:10	but the seventh day is a sabbath unto the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:
Exodus 20:11	for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.
Exodus 20:12	Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.
Exodus 20:13	Thou shalt do no murder.
Exodus 20:14	Thou shalt not commit adultery.
Exodus 20:15	Thou shalt not steal.
Exodus 20:16	Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.
Exodus 20:17	Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour’s.
Exodus 20:18	And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the voice of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they trembled, and stood afar off.
Exodus 20:19	And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.
Exodus 20:20	And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before you, that ye sin not.
Exodus 20:21	And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was.
Exodus 20:22	And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye yourselves have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.
Exodus 20:23	Ye shall not make other gods with me; gods of silver, or gods of gold, ye shall not make unto you.
Exodus 20:24	An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in every place where I record my name I will come unto thee and I will bless thee.
Exodus 20:25	And if thou make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stones: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it.
Exodus 20:26	Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon.
Exodus 21:1	Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them.
Exodus 21:2	If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.
Exodus 21:3	If he come in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he be married, then his wife shall go out with him.
Exodus 21:4	If his master give him a wife, and she bear him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master’s, and he shall go out by himself.
Exodus 21:5	But if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free:
Exodus 21:6	then his master shall bring him unto God, and shall bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for ever.
Exodus 21:7	And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do.
Exodus 21:8	If she please not her master, who hath espoused her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange people he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.
Exodus 21:9	And if he espouse her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.
Exodus 21:10	If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.
Exodus 21:11	And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out for nothing, without money.
Exodus 21:12	He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall surely be put to death.
Exodus 21:13	And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.
Exodus 21:14	And if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die.
Exodus 21:15	And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death.
Exodus 21:16	And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.
Exodus 21:17	And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death.
Exodus 21:18	And if men contend, and one smiteth the other with a stone, or with his fist, and he die not, but keep his bed:
Exodus 21:19	if he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.
Exodus 21:20	And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall surely be punished.
Exodus 21:21	Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he is his money.
Exodus 21:22	And if men strive together, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely fined, according as the woman’s husband shall lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.
Exodus 21:23	But if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life,
Exodus 21:24	eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,
Exodus 21:25	burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.
Exodus 21:26	And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, and destroy it; he shall let him go free for his eye’s sake.
Exodus 21:27	And if he smite out his manservant’s tooth, or his maidservant’s tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth’s sake.
Exodus 21:28	And if an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die, the ox shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be quit.
Exodus 21:29	But if the ox were wont to gore in time past, and it hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, but that he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death.
Exodus 21:30	If there be laid on him a ransom, then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatsoever is laid upon him.
Exodus 21:31	Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done unto him.
Exodus 21:32	If the ox gore a manservant or a maidservant; he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.
Exodus 21:33	And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein,
Exodus 21:34	the owner of the pit shall make it good; he shall give money unto the owner of them, and the dead beast shall be his.
Exodus 21:35	And if one man’s ox hurt another’s, that he die; then they shall sell the live ox, and divide the price of it; and the dead also they shall divide.
Exodus 21:36	Or if it be known that the ox was wont to gore in time past, and his owner hath not kept him in; he shall surely pay ox for ox, and the dead beast shall be his own.
Exodus 22:1	If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he shall pay five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.
Exodus 22:2	If the thief be found breaking in, and be smitten that he die, there shall be no bloodguiltiness for him.
Exodus 22:3	If the sun be risen upon him, there shall be bloodguiltiness for him: he should make restitution; if he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.
Exodus 22:4	If the theft be found in his hand alive, whether it be ox, or ass, or sheep; he shall pay double.
Exodus 22:5	If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall let his beast loose, and it feed in another man’s field; of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make restitution.
Exodus 22:6	If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the shocks of corn, or the standing corn, or the field, be consumed; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.
Exodus 22:7	If a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep, and it be stolen out of the man’s house; if the thief be found, he shall pay double.
Exodus 22:8	If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall come near unto God, to see whether he have not put his hand unto his neighbour’s goods.
Exodus 22:9	For every matter of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for sheep, for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing, whereof one saith, This is it, the cause of both parties shall come before God; he whom God shall condemn shall pay double unto his neighbour.
Exodus 22:10	If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it:
Exodus 22:11	the oath of the LORD shall be between them both, whether he hath not put his hand unto his neighbour’s goods; and the owner thereof shall accept it, and he shall not make restitution.
Exodus 22:12	But if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof.
Exodus 22:13	If it be torn in pieces, let him bring it for witness; he shall not make good that which was torn.
Exodus 22:14	And if a man borrow aught of his neighbour, and it be hurt, or die, the owner thereof not being with it, he shall surely make restitution.
Exodus 22:15	If the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it good: if it be an hired thing, it came for its hire.
Exodus 22:16	And if a man entice a virgin that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely pay a dowry for her to be his wife.
Exodus 22:17	If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.
Exodus 22:18	Thou shalt not suffer a sorceress to live.
Exodus 22:19	Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death.
Exodus 22:20	He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the LORD only, shall be utterly destroyed.
Exodus 22:21	And a stranger shalt thou not wrong, neither shalt thou oppress him: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.
Exodus 22:22	Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.
Exodus 22:23	If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me, I will surely hear their cry;
Exodus 22:24	and my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.
Exodus 22:25	If thou lend money to any of my people with thee that is poor, thou shalt not be to him as a creditor; neither shall ye lay upon him usury.
Exodus 22:26	If thou at all take thy neighbour’s garment to pledge, thou shalt restore it unto him by that the sun goeth down:
Exodus 22:27	for that is his only covering, it is his garment for his skin: wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I am gracious.
Exodus 22:28	Thou shalt not revile God, nor curse a ruler of thy people.
Exodus 22:29	Thou shalt not delay to offer of the abundance of thy fruits, and of thy liquors. The firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me.
Exodus 22:30	Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, and with thy sheep: seven days it shall be with its dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it me.
Exodus 22:31	And ye shall be holy men unto me: therefore ye shall not eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs.
Exodus 23:1	Thou shalt not take up a false report: put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness.
Exodus 23:2	Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to turn aside after a multitude to wrest judgment:
Exodus 23:3	neither shalt thou favour a poor man in his cause.
Exodus 23:4	If thou meet thine enemy’s ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again.
Exodus 23:5	If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with him.
Exodus 23:6	Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause.
Exodus 23:7	Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.
Exodus 23:8	And thou shalt take no gift: for a gift blindeth them that have sight, and perverteth the words of the righteous.
Exodus 23:9	And a stranger shalt thou not oppress: for ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.
Exodus 23:10	And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the increase thereof:
Exodus 23:11	but the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie fallow; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beast of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard.
Exodus 23:12	Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass may have rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.
Exodus 23:13	And in all things that I have said unto you take ye heed: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth.
Exodus 23:14	Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year.
Exodus 23:15	The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep: seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, at the time appointed in the month Abib (for in it thou camest out from Egypt); and none shall appear before me empty:
Exodus 23:16	and the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours, which thou sowest in the field: and the feast of ingathering, at the end of the year, when thou gatherest in thy labours out of the field.
Exodus 23:17	Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord GOD.
Exodus 23:18	Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my feast remain all night until the morning.
Exodus 23:19	The first of the firstfruits of thy ground thou shalt bring into the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother’s milk.
Exodus 23:20	Behold, I send an angel before thee, to keep thee by the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.

Exodus 29:26	And thou shalt take the breast of Aaron’s ram of consecration, and wave it for a wave offering before the LORD: and it shall be thy portion.
Exodus 29:27	And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the thigh of the heave offering, which is waved, and which is heaved up, of the ram of consecration, even of that which is for Aaron, and of that which is for his sons:
Exodus 29:28	and it shall be for Aaron and his sons as a due for ever from the children of Israel: for it is an heave offering: and it shall be an heave offering from the children of Israel of the sacrifices of their peace offerings, even their heave offering unto the LORD.

Exodus 29:33	And they shall eat those things wherewith atonement was made, to consecrate and to sanctify them: but a stranger shall not eat thereof, because they are holy.
Exodus 29:34	And if aught of the flesh of the consecration, or of the bread, remain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it is holy.
Exodus 29:35	And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according to all that I have commanded thee: seven days shalt thou consecrate them.
Exodus 29:36	And every day shalt thou offer the bullock of sin offering for atonement: and thou shalt cleanse the altar, when thou makest atonement for it; and thou shalt anoint it, to sanctify it.
Exodus 29:37	Seven days thou shalt make atonement for the altar, and sanctify it: and the altar shall be most holy; whatsoever toucheth the altar shall be holy.
Exodus 29:38	Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two lambs of the first year day by day continually.
Exodus 29:39	The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb thou shalt offer at even:
Exodus 29:40	and with the one lamb a tenth part of an ephah of fine flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering.
Exodus 29:41	And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do thereto according to the meal offering of the morning, and according to the drink offering thereof, for a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
Exodus 29:42	It shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tent of meeting before the LORD: where I will meet with you, to speak there unto thee.
Exodus 29:43	And there I will meet with the children of Israel; and the Tent shall be sanctified by my glory.

Exodus 30:1	And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: of acacia wood shalt thou make it.
Exodus 30:2	A cubit shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof; foursquare shall it be: and two cubits shall be the height thereof: the horns thereof shall be of one piece with it.
Exodus 30:3	And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about.

Exodus 30:11	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Exodus 30:12	When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel, according to those that are numbered of them, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the LORD, when thou numberest them; that there be no plague among them, when thou numberest them.
Exodus 30:13	This they shall give, every one that passeth over unto them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: (the shekel is twenty gerahs:) half a shekel for an offering to the LORD.
Exodus 30:14	Every one that passeth over unto them that are numbered, from twenty years old and upward, shall give the offering of the LORD.
Exodus 30:15	The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less, than the half shekel, when they give the offering of the LORD, to make atonement for your souls.

Exodus 30:17	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Exodus 30:18	Thou shalt also make a laver of brass, and the base thereof of brass, to wash withal: and thou shalt put it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein.
Exodus 30:19	And Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat:
Exodus 30:20	when they go into the tent of meeting, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn an offering made by fire unto the LORD:
Exodus 30:21	so they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to his seed throughout their generations.
Exodus 30:22	Moreover the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Exodus 30:23	Take thou also unto thee the chief spices, of flowing myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty,
Exodus 30:24	and of cassia five hundred, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of olive oil an hin:
Exodus 30:25	and thou shalt make it an holy anointing oil, a perfume compounded after the art of the perfumer: it shall be an holy anointing oil.
Exodus 30:26	And thou shalt anoint therewith the tent of meeting, and the ark of the testimony,
Exodus 30:27	and the table and all the vessels thereof, and the candlestick and the vessels thereof, and the altar of incense,
Exodus 30:28	and the altar of burnt offering with all the vessels thereof, and the laver and the base thereof.

Exodus 30:34	And the LORD said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; sweet spices with pure frankincense: of each shall there be a like weight;
Exodus 30:35	and thou shalt make of it incense, a perfume after the art of the perfumer, seasoned with salt, pure and holy:
Exodus 30:36	and thou shalt beat some of it very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tent of meeting, where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you most holy.
Exodus 30:37	And the incense which thou shalt make, according to the composition thereof ye shall not make for yourselves: it shall be unto thee holy for the LORD.
Exodus 30:38	Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, he shall be cut off from his people.
Exodus 31:1	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Exodus 31:2	See, I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah:
Exodus 31:3	and I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,
Exodus 31:4	to devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,
Exodus 31:5	and in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all manner of workmanship.
Exodus 31:6	And I, behold, I have appointed with him Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee:
Exodus 31:7	the tent of meeting, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy-seat that is thereupon, and all the furniture of the Tent;
Exodus 31:8	and the table and its vessels, and the pure candlestick with all its vessels, and the altar of incense;
Exodus 31:9	and the altar of burnt offering with all its vessels, and the laver and its base;
Exodus 31:10	and the finely wrought garments, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest’s office;
Exodus 31:11	and the anointing oil, and the incense of sweet spices for the holy place: according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do.
Exodus 31:12	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Exodus 31:13	Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily ye shall keep my sabbaths: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the LORD which sanctify you.
Exodus 31:14	Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: every one that profaneth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.
Exodus 31:15	Six days shall work be done; but on the seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, holy to the LORD: whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.
Exodus 31:16	Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.
Exodus 31:17	It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.
Exodus 31:18	And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, the two tables of the testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.
Exodus 32:1	And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.
Exodus 32:2	And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden rings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them unto me.
Exodus 32:3	And all the people brake off the golden rings which were in their ears, and brought them unto Aaron.
Exodus 32:4	And he received it at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, and made it a molten calf: and they said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
Exodus 32:5	And when Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, Tomorrow shall be a feast to the LORD.
Exodus 32:6	And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.
Exodus 32:7	And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, which thou broughtest up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves:
Exodus 32:8	they have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed unto it, and said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
Exodus 32:9	And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:
Exodus 32:10	now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation.
Exodus 32:11	And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?
Exodus 32:12	Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, saying, For evil did he bring them forth, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people.
Exodus 32:13	Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.
Exodus 32:14	And the LORD repented of the evil which he said he would do unto his people.
Exodus 32:15	And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, with the two tables of the testimony in his hand; tables that were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.
Exodus 32:16	And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables.
Exodus 32:17	And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.
Exodus 32:18	And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome: but the noise of them that sing do I hear.
Exodus 32:19	And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf and the dancing: and Moses’ anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.
Exodus 32:20	And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it with fire, and ground it to powder, and strewed it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it.
Exodus 32:21	And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought a great sin upon them?
Exodus 32:22	And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they are set on evil.
Exodus 32:23	For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.
Exodus 32:24	And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it off; so they gave it me: and I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.
Exodus 32:25	And when Moses saw that the people were broken loose; for Aaron had let them loose for a derision among their enemies:
Exodus 32:26	then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Whoso is on the LORD’S side, let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him.
Exodus 32:27	And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, Put ye every man his sword upon his thigh, and go to and fro from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.
Exodus 32:28	And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.
Exodus 32:29	And Moses said, Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD, yea, every man against his son, and against his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.
Exodus 32:30	And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the LORD; peradventure I shall make atonement for your sin.
Exodus 32:31	And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.
Exodus 32:32	Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin—; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.
Exodus 32:33	And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.
Exodus 32:34	And now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee: behold, mine angel shall go before thee: nevertheless in the day when I visit, I will visit their sin upon them.
Exodus 32:35	And the LORD smote the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.
Exodus 33:1	And the LORD spake unto Moses, Depart, go up hence, thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land of which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give it:
Exodus 33:2	and I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:
Exodus 33:3	unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou art a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in the way.
Exodus 33:4	And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments.
Exodus 33:5	And the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye are a stiffnecked people: if I go up into the midst of thee for one moment, I shall consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.
Exodus 33:6	And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments from mount Horeb onward.
Exodus 33:7	Now Moses used to take the tent and to pitch it without the camp, afar off from the camp; and he called it, The tent of meeting. And it came to pass, that every one which sought the LORD went out unto the tent of meeting, which was without the camp.
Exodus 33:8	And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the Tent, that all the people rose up, and stood, every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the Tent.
Exodus 33:9	And it came to pass, when Moses entered into the Tent, the pillar of cloud descended, and stood at the door of the Tent: and the LORD spake with Moses.
Exodus 33:10	And all the people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the door of the Tent: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man at his tent door.
Exodus 33:11	And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his minister Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the Tent.
Exodus 33:12	And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight.
Exodus 33:13	Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew me now thy ways, that I may know thee, to the end that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy people.
Exodus 33:14	And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest.
Exodus 33:15	And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hence.
Exodus 33:16	For wherein now shall it be known that I have found grace in thy sight, I and thy people? is it not in that thou goest with us, so that we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth?
Exodus 33:17	And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name.
Exodus 33:18	And he said, Shew me, I pray thee, thy glory.
Exodus 33:19	And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy.
Exodus 33:20	And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for man shall not see me and live.
Exodus 33:21	And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon the rock:
Exodus 33:22	and it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a cleft of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand until I have passed by:
Exodus 33:23	and I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back: but my face shall not be seen.
Exodus 34:1	And the LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first: and I will write upon the tables the words that were on the first tables, which thou brakest.
Exodus 34:2	And be ready by the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me on the top of the mount.
Exodus 34:3	And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount.
Exodus 34:4	And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand two tables of stone.
Exodus 34:5	And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD.
Exodus 34:6	And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, the LORD, a God full of compassion and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy and truth;
Exodus 34:7	keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin: and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children’s children, upon the third and upon the fourth generation.
Exodus 34:8	And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped.
Exodus 34:9	And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O Lord, let the Lord, I pray thee, go in the midst of us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance.
Exodus 34:10	And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do marvels, such as have not been wrought in all the earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the LORD, for it is a terrible thing that I do with thee.
Exodus 34:11	Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.
Exodus 34:12	Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee:
Exodus 34:13	but ye shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and ye shall cut down their Asherim:
Exodus 34:14	for thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God:
Exodus 34:15	lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods, and one call thee and thou eat of his sacrifice;
Exodus 34:16	and thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods.
Exodus 34:17	Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.
Exodus 34:18	The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, at the time appointed in the month Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt.
Exodus 34:19	All that openeth the womb is mine; and all thy cattle that is male, the firstlings of ox and sheep.
Exodus 34:20	And the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break its neck. All the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before me empty.
Exodus 34:21	Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest: in plowing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.
Exodus 34:22	And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, even of the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year’s end.
Exodus 34:23	Three times in the year shall all thy males appear before the Lord GOD, the God of Israel.
Exodus 34:24	For I will cast out nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou goest up to appear before the LORD thy God three times in the year.
Exodus 34:25	Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning.
Exodus 34:26	The first of the firstfruits of thy ground thou shalt bring unto the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother’s milk.
Exodus 34:27	And the LORD said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel.
Exodus 34:28	And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.
Exodus 34:29	And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of the testimony in Moses’ hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone by reason of his speaking with him.
Exodus 34:30	And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him.
Exodus 34:31	And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him: and Moses spake to them.
Exodus 34:32	And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount Sinai.
Exodus 34:33	And when Moses had done speaking with them, he put a veil on his face.
Exodus 34:34	But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he took the veil off, until he came out; and he came out, and spake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded;
Exodus 34:35	and the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses’ face shone: and Moses put the veil upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him.
Exodus 35:1	And Moses assembled all the congregation of the children of Israel, and said unto them, These are the words which the LORD hath commanded, that ye should do them.
Exodus 35:2	Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day, a sabbath of solemn rest to the LORD: whosoever doeth any work therein shall be put to death.
Exodus 35:3	Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day.
Exodus 35:4	And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD commanded, saying,
Exodus 35:5	Take ye from among you an offering unto the LORD: whosoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it, the LORD’S offering; gold, and silver, and brass;
Exodus 35:6	and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats’ hair;
Exodus 35:7	and rams’ skins dyed red, and sealskins, and acacia wood;
Exodus 35:8	and oil for the light, and spices for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense;
Exodus 35:9	and onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate.
Exodus 35:10	And let every wise hearted man among you come, and make all that the LORD hath commanded;
Exodus 35:11	the tabernacle, its tent, and its covering, its clasps, and its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets;
Exodus 35:12	the ark, and the staves thereof, the mercy-seat, and the veil of the screen;
Exodus 35:13	the table, and its staves, and all its vessels, and the shewbread;
Exodus 35:14	the candlestick also for the light, and its vessels, and its lamps, and the oil for the light;
Exodus 35:15	and the altar of incense, and its staves, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the screen for the door, at the door of the tabernacle;
Exodus 35:16	the altar of burnt offering, with its grating of brass, its staves, and all its vessels, the laver and its base;
Exodus 35:17	the hangings of the court, the pillars thereof, and their sockets, and the screen for the gate of the court;
Exodus 35:18	the pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their cords;

Exodus 39:22	And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue;
Exodus 39:23	and the hole of the robe in the midst thereof, as the hole of a coat of mail, with a binding round about the hole of it, that it should not be rent.
Exodus 39:24	And they made upon the skirts of the robe pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen.
Exodus 39:25	And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the skirts of the robe round about, between the pomegranates;
Exodus 39:26	a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, upon the skirts of the robe round about, to minister in; as the LORD commanded Moses.

Exodus 39:32	Thus was finished all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting: and the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.
Exodus 39:33	And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the Tent, and all its furniture, its clasps, its boards, its bars, and its pillars, and its sockets;

Exodus 39:43	And Moses saw all the work, and, behold, they had done it; as the LORD had commanded, even so had they done it: and Moses blessed them.
Exodus 40:1	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Exodus 40:2	On the first day of the first month shalt thou rear up the tabernacle of the tent of meeting.
Exodus 40:3	And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and thou shalt screen the ark with the veil.
Exodus 40:4	And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof.
Exodus 40:5	And thou shalt set the golden altar for incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the screen of the door to the tabernacle.
Exodus 40:6	And thou shalt set the altar of burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting.
Exodus 40:7	And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar, and shalt put water therein.
Exodus 40:8	And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the screen of the gate of the court.
Exodus 40:9	And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the furniture thereof: and it shall be holy.
Exodus 40:10	And thou shalt anoint the altar of burnt offering, and all its vessels, and sanctify the altar: and the altar shall be most holy.
Exodus 40:11	And thou shalt anoint the laver and its base, and sanctify it.
Exodus 40:12	And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tent of meeting, and shalt wash them with water.
Exodus 40:13	And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments; and thou shalt anoint him, and sanctify him, that he may minister unto me in the priest’s office.
Exodus 40:14	And thou shalt bring his sons, and put coats upon them:
Exodus 40:15	and thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the priest’s office: and their anointing shall be to them for an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.
Exodus 40:16	Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him, so did he.
Exodus 40:17	And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up.
Exodus 40:18	And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and laid its sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up its pillars.
Exodus 40:19	And he spread the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded Moses.
Exodus 40:20	And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy-seat above upon the ark:
Exodus 40:21	and he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the veil of the screen, and screened the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commanded Moses.
Exodus 40:22	And he put the table in the tent of meeting, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the veil.
Exodus 40:23	And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.
Exodus 40:24	And he put the candlestick in the tent of meeting, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.
Exodus 40:25	And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.
Exodus 40:26	And he put the golden altar in the tent of meeting before the veil:
Exodus 40:27	and he burnt thereon incense of sweet spices; as the LORD commanded Moses.
Exodus 40:28	And he put the screen of the door to the tabernacle.
Exodus 40:29	And he set the altar of burnt offering at the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meal offering; as the LORD commanded Moses.
Exodus 40:30	And he set the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water therein, to wash withal.
Exodus 40:31	And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat;
Exodus 40:32	when they went into the tent of meeting, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed: as the LORD commanded Moses.
Exodus 40:33	And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the screen of the gate of the court. So Moses finished the work.
Exodus 40:34	Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.
Exodus 40:35	And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of meeting, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.
Exodus 40:36	And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward, throughout all their journeys:
Exodus 40:37	but if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up.
Exodus 40:38	For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and there was fire therein by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.
Leviticus 1:1	And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tent of meeting, saying,
Leviticus 1:2	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any man of you offereth an oblation unto the LORD, ye shall offer your oblation of the cattle, even of the herd and of the flock.
Leviticus 1:3	If his oblation be a burnt offering of the herd, he shall offer it a male without blemish: he shall offer it at the door of the tent of meeting, that he may be accepted before the LORD.
Leviticus 1:4	And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.
Leviticus 1:5	And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall present the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that is at the door of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus 1:6	And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into its pieces.
Leviticus 1:7	And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay wood in order upon the fire:
Leviticus 1:8	and Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall lay the pieces, the head, and the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar:

Leviticus 8:20	And he cut the ram into its pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the pieces, and the fat.
Leviticus 8:21	And he washed the inwards and the legs with water; and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt offering for a sweet savour: it was an offering made by fire unto the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.
Leviticus 8:22	And he presented the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.
Leviticus 8:23	And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood thereof, and put it upon the tip of Aaron’s right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.
Leviticus 8:24	And he brought Aaron’s sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot: and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.
Leviticus 8:25	And he took the fat, and the fat tail, and all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right thigh:
Leviticus 8:26	and out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before the LORD, he took one unleavened cake, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and placed them on the fat, and upon the right thigh:
Leviticus 8:27	and he put the whole upon the hands of Aaron, and upon the hands of his sons, and waved them for a wave offering before the LORD.
Leviticus 8:28	And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on the altar upon the burnt offering: they were a consecration for a sweet savour: it was an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
Leviticus 8:29	And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering before the LORD: it was Moses’ portion of the ram of consecration; as the LORD commanded Moses.
Leviticus 8:30	And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons’ garments with him; and sanctified Aaron, his garments, and his sons, and his sons’ garments with him.
Leviticus 8:31	And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the door of the tent of meeting: and there eat it and the bread that is in the basket of consecration, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.
Leviticus 8:32	And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire.
Leviticus 8:33	And ye shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting seven days, until the days of your consecration be fulfilled: for he shall consecrate you seven days.
Leviticus 8:34	As hath been done this day, so the LORD hath commanded to do, to make atonement for you.
Leviticus 8:35	And at the door of the tent of meeting shall ye abide day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the LORD, that ye die not: for so I am commanded.
Leviticus 8:36	And Aaron and his sons did all the things which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.
Leviticus 9:1	And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;
Leviticus 9:2	and he said unto Aaron, Take thee a bull calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them before the LORD.
Leviticus 9:3	And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a he-goat for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering;
Leviticus 9:4	and an ox and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD; and a meal offering mingled with oil: for today the LORD appeareth unto you.
Leviticus 9:5	And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tent of meeting: and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD.
Leviticus 9:6	And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commanded that ye should do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto you.
Leviticus 9:7	And Moses said unto Aaron, Draw near unto the altar, and offer thy sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make atonement for thyself, and for the people: and offer the oblation of the people, and make atonement for them; as the LORD commanded.
Leviticus 9:8	So Aaron drew near unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.
Leviticus 9:9	And the sons of Aaron presented the blood unto him: and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar:
Leviticus 9:10	but the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul from the liver of the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses.
Leviticus 9:11	And the flesh and the skin he burnt with fire without the camp.
Leviticus 9:12	And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron’s sons delivered unto him the blood, and he sprinkled it upon the altar round about.
Leviticus 9:13	And they delivered the burnt offering unto him, piece by piece, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar.
Leviticus 9:14	And he washed the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the burnt offering on the altar.
Leviticus 9:15	And he presented the people’s oblation, and took the goat of the sin offering which was for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first.
Leviticus 9:16	And he presented the burnt offering, and offered it according to the ordinance.
Leviticus 9:17	And he presented the meal offering, and filled his hand therefrom, and burnt it upon the altar, besides the burnt offering of the morning.
Leviticus 9:18	He slew also the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron’s sons delivered unto him the blood, and he sprinkled it upon the altar round about,
Leviticus 9:19	and the fat of the ox; and of the ram, the fat tail, and that which covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul of the liver:
Leviticus 9:20	and they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar:
Leviticus 9:21	and the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.
Leviticus 9:22	And Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people, and blessed them; and he came down from offering the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings.
Leviticus 9:23	And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people.
Leviticus 9:24	And there came forth fire from before the LORD, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat: and when all the people saw it, they shouted, and fell on their faces.
Leviticus 10:1	And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took each of them his censer, and put fire therein, and laid incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the LORD, which he had not commanded them.
Leviticus 10:2	And there came forth fire from before the LORD, and devoured them, and they died before the LORD.
Leviticus 10:3	Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the LORD spake, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.
Leviticus 10:4	And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Draw near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.
Leviticus 10:5	So they drew near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp; as Moses had said.
Leviticus 10:6	And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, Let not the hair of your heads go loose, neither rend your clothes; that ye die not, and that he be not wroth with all the congregation: but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the LORD hath kindled.
Leviticus 10:7	And ye shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the LORD is upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses.
Leviticus 10:8	And the LORD spake unto Aaron, saying,
Leviticus 10:9	Drink no wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tent of meeting, that ye die not: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations:
Leviticus 10:10	and that ye may put difference between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean;
Leviticus 10:11	and that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the LORD hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.
Leviticus 10:12	And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left, Take the meal offering that remaineth of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar: for it is most holy:
Leviticus 10:13	and ye shall eat it in a holy place, because it is thy due, and thy sons’ due, of the offerings of the LORD made by fire: for so I am commanded.
Leviticus 10:14	And the wave breast and the heave thigh shall ye eat in a clean place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for they are given as thy due, and thy sons’ due, out of the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the children of Israel.
Leviticus 10:15	The heave thigh and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering before the LORD: and it shall be thine, and thy sons’ with thee, as a due for ever; as the LORD hath commanded.
Leviticus 10:16	And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and with Ithamar, the sons of Aaron that were left, saying,
Leviticus 10:17	Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the place of the sanctuary, seeing it is most holy, and he hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD?
Leviticus 10:18	Behold, the blood of it was not brought into the sanctuary within: ye should certainly have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded.
Leviticus 10:19	And Aaron spake unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD; and there have befallen me such things as these: and if I had eaten the sin offering today, would it have been well-pleasing in the sight of the LORD?
Leviticus 10:20	And when Moses heard that, it was well-pleasing in his sight.
Leviticus 11:1	And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,
Leviticus 11:2	Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the living things which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth.
Leviticus 11:3	Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat.
Leviticus 11:4	Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that part the hoof: the camel, because he cheweth the cud but parteth not the hoof, he is unclean unto you.
Leviticus 11:5	And the coney, because he cheweth the cud but parteth not the hoof, he is unclean unto you.
Leviticus 11:6	And the hare, because she cheweth the cud but parteth not the hoof, she is unclean unto you.
Leviticus 11:7	And the swine, because he parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, but cheweth not the cud, he is unclean unto you.
Leviticus 11:8	Of their flesh ye shall not eat, and their carcases ye shall not touch; they are unclean unto you.
Leviticus 11:9	These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat.
Leviticus 11:10	And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of all the living creatures that are in the waters, they are an abomination unto you,
Leviticus 11:11	and they shall be an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, and their carcases ye shall have in abomination.
Leviticus 11:12	Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that is an abomination unto you.
Leviticus 11:13	And these ye shall have in abomination among the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, and the gier eagle, and the ospray;
Leviticus 11:14	and the kite, and the falcon after its kind;
Leviticus 11:15	every raven after its kind;
Leviticus 11:16	and the ostrich, and the night hawk, and the seamew, and the hawk after its kind;
Leviticus 11:17	and the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl;
Leviticus 11:18	and the horned owl, and the pelican, and the vulture;
Leviticus 11:19	and the stork, the heron after its kind, and the hoopoe, and the bat.
Leviticus 11:20	All winged creeping things that go upon all four are an abomination unto you.
Leviticus 11:21	Yet these may ye eat of all winged creeping things that go upon all four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon the earth;
Leviticus 11:22	even these of them ye may eat; the locust after its kind, and the bald locust after its kind, and the cricket after its kind, and the grasshopper after its kind.
Leviticus 11:23	But all winged creeping things, which have four feet, are an abomination unto you.
Leviticus 11:24	And by these ye shall become unclean: whosoever toucheth the carcase of them shall be unclean until the even:
Leviticus 11:25	And whosoever beareth aught of the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus 11:26	Every beast which parteth the hoof, and is not clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, is unclean unto you: every one that toucheth them shall be unclean.
Leviticus 11:27	And whatsoever goeth upon its paws, among all beasts that go on all four, they are unclean unto you: whoso toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even.
Leviticus 11:28	And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: they are unclean unto you.
Leviticus 11:29	And these are they which are unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the great lizard after its kind,
Leviticus 11:30	and the gecko, and the land-crocodile, and the lizard, and the sand-lizard, and the chameleon.
Leviticus 11:31	These are they which are unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth touch them, when they are dead, shall be unclean until the even.
Leviticus 11:32	And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel it be, wherewith any work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; then shall it be clean.
Leviticus 11:33	And every earthen vessel, whereinto any of them falleth, whatsoever is in it shall be unclean, and it ye shall break.
Leviticus 11:34	All food therein which may be eaten, that on which water cometh, shall be unclean: and all drink that may be drunk in every such vessel shall be unclean.
Leviticus 11:35	And every thing whereupon any part of their carcase falleth shall be unclean; whether oven, or range for pots, it shall be broken in pieces: they are unclean, and shall be unclean unto you.
Leviticus 11:36	Nevertheless a fountain or a pit wherein is a gathering of water shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcase shall be unclean.
Leviticus 11:37	And if aught of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown, it is clean.
Leviticus 11:38	But if water be put upon the seed, and aught of their carcase fall thereon, it is unclean unto you.
Leviticus 11:39	And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even.
Leviticus 11:40	And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: he also that beareth the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus 11:41	And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth is an abomination; it shall not be eaten.
Leviticus 11:42	Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all four, or whatsoever hath many feet, even all creeping things that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are an abomination.
Leviticus 11:43	Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby.
Leviticus 11:44	For I am the LORD your God: sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy; for I am holy: neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that moveth upon the earth.
Leviticus 11:45	For I am the LORD that brought you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.
Leviticus 11:46	This is the law of the beast, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth:
Leviticus 11:47	to make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between the living thing that may be eaten and the living thing that may not be eaten.
Leviticus 12:1	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus 12:2	Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman conceive seed, and bear a man child, then she shall be unclean seven days; as in the days of the impurity of her sickness shall she be unclean.
Leviticus 12:3	And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.
Leviticus 12:4	And she shall continue in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled.
Leviticus 12:5	But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her impurity: and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying threescore and six days.
Leviticus 12:6	And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering, unto the door of the tent of meeting, unto the priest:
Leviticus 12:7	and he shall offer it before the LORD, and make atonement for her; and she shall be cleansed from the fountain of her blood. This is the law for her that beareth, whether a male or a female.
Leviticus 12:8	And if her means suffice not for a lamb, then she shall take two turtledoves, or two young pigeons; the one for a burnt offering, and the other for a sin offering: and the priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be clean.
Leviticus 13:1	And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
Leviticus 13:2	When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, or a scab, or a bright spot, and it become in the skin of his flesh the plague of leprosy, then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests:
Leviticus 13:3	and the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and if the hair in the plague be turned white, and the appearance of the plague be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is the plague of leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean.
Leviticus 13:4	And if the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white, then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague seven days:
Leviticus 13:5	and the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold, if in his eyes the plague be at a stay, and the plague be not spread in the skin, then the priest shall shut him up seven days more:
Leviticus 13:6	and the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and, behold, if the plague be dim, and the plague be not spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean: it is a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.
Leviticus 13:7	But if the scab spread abroad in the skin, after that he hath shewn himself to the priest for his cleansing, he shall shew himself to the priest again:
Leviticus 13:8	and the priest shall look, and, behold, if the scab be spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is leprosy.
Leviticus 13:9	When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought unto the priest;
Leviticus 13:10	and the priest shall look, and, behold, if there be a white rising in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and there be quick raw flesh in the rising,
Leviticus 13:11	it is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean: he shall not shut him up; for he is unclean.
Leviticus 13:12	And if the leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head even to his feet, as far as appeareth to the priest;
Leviticus 13:13	then the priest shall look: and, behold, if the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague: it is all turned white: he is clean.
Leviticus 13:14	But whensoever raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.
Leviticus 13:15	And the priest shall look on the raw flesh, and pronounce him unclean: the raw flesh is unclean: it is leprosy.
Leviticus 13:16	Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, then he shall come unto the priest,
Leviticus 13:17	and the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the plague be turned into white, then the priest shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague: he is clean.
Leviticus 13:18	And when the flesh hath in the skin thereof a boil, and it is healed,
Leviticus 13:19	and in the place of the boil there is a white rising, or a bright spot, reddish-white, then it shall be shewed to the priest;
Leviticus 13:20	and the priest shall look, and, behold, if the appearance thereof be lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy, it hath broken out in the boil.
Leviticus 13:21	But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hairs therein, and it be not lower than the skin, but be dim, then the priest shall shut him up seven days:
Leviticus 13:22	And if it spread abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague.
Leviticus 13:23	But if the bright spot stay in its place, and be not spread, it is the scar of the boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
Leviticus 13:24	Or when the flesh hath in the skin thereof a burning by fire, and the quick flesh of the burning become a bright spot, reddish-white, or white;
Leviticus 13:25	then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and the appearance thereof be deeper than the skin; it is leprosy, it hath broken out in the burning: and the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.
Leviticus 13:26	But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hair in the bright spot, and it be no lower than the skin, but be dim; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:
Leviticus 13:27	and the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: if it spread abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.
Leviticus 13:28	And if the bright spot stay in its place, and be not spread in the skin, but be dim; it is the rising of the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean: for it is the scar of the burning.
Leviticus 13:29	And when a man or woman hath a plague upon the head or upon the beard,
Leviticus 13:30	then the priest shall look on the plague: and, behold, if the appearance thereof be deeper than the skin, and there be in it yellow thin hair, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a scall, it is leprosy of the head or of the beard.
Leviticus 13:31	And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold, the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin, and there be no black hair in it, then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague of the scall seven days:
Leviticus 13:32	And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague: and, behold, if the scall be not spread, and there be in it no yellow hair, and the appearance of the scall be not deeper than the skin,
Leviticus 13:33	then he shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the priest shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more:
Leviticus 13:34	and in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall: and, behold, if the scall be not spread in the skin, and the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.
Leviticus 13:35	But if the scall spread abroad in the skin after his cleansing;
Leviticus 13:36	then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scall be spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for the yellow hair; he is unclean.
Leviticus 13:37	But if in his eyes the scall be at a stay, and black hair be grown up therein; the scall is healed, he is clean: and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
Leviticus 13:38	And when a man or a woman hath in the skin of their flesh bright spots, even white bright spots;
Leviticus 13:39	then the priest shall look: and, behold, if the bright spots in the skin of their flesh be of a dull white; it is a tetter, it hath broken out in the skin; he is clean.
Leviticus 13:40	And if a man’s hair be fallen off his head, he is bald; yet is he clean.
Leviticus 13:41	And if his hair be fallen off from the front part of his head, he is forehead bald; yet is he clean.
Leviticus 13:42	But if there be in the bald head, or the bald forehead, a reddish-white plague; it is leprosy breaking out in his bald head, or his bald forehead.
Leviticus 13:43	Then the priest shall look upon him: and, behold, if the rising of the plague be reddish-white in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the appearance of leprosy in the skin of the flesh;
Leviticus 13:44	he is a leprous man, he is unclean: the priest shall surely pronounce him unclean; his plague is in his head.
Leviticus 13:45	And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and the hair of his head shall go loose, and he shall cover his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.
Leviticus 13:46	All the days wherein the plague is in him he shall be unclean; he is unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp shall his dwelling be.
Leviticus 13:47	The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it be a woollen garment, or a linen garment;
Leviticus 13:48	whether it be in warp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen; whether in a skin, or in any thing made of skin;
Leviticus 13:49	if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it is the plague of leprosy, and shall be shewed unto the priest:
Leviticus 13:50	and the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up that which hath the plague seven days:
Leviticus 13:51	and he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the plague be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in the skin, whatever service skin is used for; the plague is a fretting leprosy; it is unclean.
Leviticus 13:52	And he shall burn the garment, whether the warp or the woof, in woollen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague is: for it is a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire.
Leviticus 13:53	And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin;
Leviticus 13:54	then the priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein the plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more:
Leviticus 13:55	and the priest shall look, after that the plague is washed: and, behold, if the plague have not changed its colour, and the plague be not spread, it is unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire: it is a fret, whether the bareness be within or without.
Leviticus 13:56	And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague be dim after the washing thereof, then he shall rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof:
Leviticus 13:57	and if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin, it is breaking out: thou shalt burn that wherein the plague is with fire.
Leviticus 13:58	And the garment, either the warp, or the woof, or whatsoever thing of skin it be, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean.
Leviticus 13:59	This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen or linen, either in the warp, or the woof, or any thing of skin, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.
Leviticus 14:1	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus 14:2	This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: he shall be brought unto the priest:
Leviticus 14:3	and the priest shall go forth out of the camp; and the priest shall look, and, behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper;
Leviticus 14:4	then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two living clean birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:
Leviticus 14:5	And the priest shall command to kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water:

Leviticus 14:34	When ye be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession;
Leviticus 14:35	then he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, There seemeth to me to be as it were a plague in the house:
Leviticus 14:36	and the priest shall command that they empty the house, before the priest go in to see the plague, that all that is in the house be not made unclean: and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house:
Leviticus 14:37	and he shall look on the plague, and, behold, if the plague be in the walls of the house with hollow strakes, greenish or reddish, and the appearance thereof be lower than the wall;
Leviticus 14:38	then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days:
Leviticus 14:39	and the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall look: and, behold, if the plague be spread in the walls of the house;
Leviticus 14:40	then the priest shall command that they take out the stones in which the plague is, and cast them into an unclean place without the city:
Leviticus 14:41	and he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they shall pour out the mortar that they scrape off without the city into an unclean place:
Leviticus 14:42	and they shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones; and he shall take other mortar, and shall plaister the house.
Leviticus 14:43	And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after that he hath taken out the stones, and after he hath scraped the house, and after it is plaistered;

Leviticus 17:4	and hath not brought it unto the door of the tent of meeting, to offer it as an oblation unto the LORD before the tabernacle of the LORD: blood shall be imputed unto that man; he hath shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his people:
Leviticus 17:5	To the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they sacrifice in the open field, even that they may bring them unto the LORD, unto the door of the tent of meeting, unto the priest, and sacrifice them for sacrifices of peace offerings unto the LORD.

Leviticus 17:9	and bringeth it not unto the door of the tent of meeting, to sacrifice it unto the LORD; even that man shall be cut off from his people.
Leviticus 17:10	And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, that eateth any manner of blood; I will set my face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people.

Leviticus 18:5	Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which if a man do, he shall live in them: I am the LORD.
Leviticus 18:6	None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness: I am the LORD.

Leviticus 18:25	And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land vomiteth out her inhabitants.
Leviticus 18:26	Ye therefore shall keep my statutes and my judgments, and shall not do any of these abominations; neither the homeborn, nor the stranger that sojourneth among you:
Leviticus 18:27	(for all these abominations have the men of the land done, which were before you, and the land is defiled;)
Leviticus 18:28	that the land vomit not you out also, when ye defile it, as it vomited out the nation that was before you.
Leviticus 18:29	For whosoever shall do any of these abominations, even the souls that do them shall be cut off from among their people.

Leviticus 19:18	Thou shalt not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the LORD.
Leviticus 19:19	Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with two kinds of seed: neither shall there come upon thee a garment of two kinds of stuff mingled together.
Leviticus 19:20	And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid, betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; they shall be punished; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free.
Leviticus 19:21	And he shall bring his guilt offering unto the LORD, unto the door of the tent of meeting, even a ram for a guilt offering.
Leviticus 19:22	And the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering before the LORD for his sin which he hath sinned: and he shall be forgiven for his sin which he hath sinned.
Leviticus 19:23	And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as their uncircumcision: three years shall they be as uncircumcised unto you; it shall not be eaten.
Leviticus 19:24	But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy, for giving praise unto the LORD.
Leviticus 19:25	And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you the increase thereof: I am the LORD your God.
Leviticus 19:26	Ye shall not eat any thing with the blood: neither shall ye use enchantments, nor practise augury.
Leviticus 19:27	Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard.
Leviticus 19:28	Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I am the LORD.
Leviticus 19:29	Profane not thy daughter, to make her a harlot; lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness.
Leviticus 19:30	Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD.
Leviticus 19:31	Turn ye not unto them that have familiar spirits, nor unto the wizards; seek them not out, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God.

Leviticus 19:33	And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not do him wrong.
Leviticus 19:34	The stranger that sojourneth with you shall be unto you as the homeborn among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.
Leviticus 19:35	Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in measure.
Leviticus 19:36	Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt.
Leviticus 19:37	And ye shall observe all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: I am the LORD.
Leviticus 20:1	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus 20:2	Moreover, thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever he be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that giveth of his seed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones.
Leviticus 20:3	I also will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.
Leviticus 20:4	And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from that man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and put him not to death:
Leviticus 20:5	then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to commit whoredom with Molech, from among their people.
Leviticus 20:6	And the soul that turneth unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto the wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.
Leviticus 20:7	Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am the LORD your God.
Leviticus 20:8	And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am the LORD which sanctify you.
Leviticus 20:9	For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall surely be put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be upon him.
Leviticus 20:10	And the man that committeth adultery with another man’s wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour’s wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.
Leviticus 20:11	And the man that lieth with his father’s wife hath uncovered his father’s nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.
Leviticus 20:12	And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their blood shall be upon them.
Leviticus 20:13	And if a man lie with mankind, as with womankind, both of them have committed abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.
Leviticus 20:14	And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you.
Leviticus 20:15	And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death: and ye shall slay the beast.
Leviticus 20:16	And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.
Leviticus 20:17	And if a man shall take his sister, his father’s daughter, or his mother’s daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it is a shameful thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of the children of their people: he hath uncovered his sister’s nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity.
Leviticus 20:18	And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness; he hath made naked her fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them shall be cut off from among their people.
Leviticus 20:19	And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother’s sister, nor of thy father’s sister: for he hath made naked his near kin: they shall bear their iniquity.
Leviticus 20:20	And if a man shall lie with his uncle’s wife, he hath uncovered his uncle’s nakedness: they shall bear their sin; they shall die childless.
Leviticus 20:21	And if a man shall take his brother’s wife, it is impurity: he hath uncovered his brother’s nakedness; they shall be childless.
Leviticus 20:22	Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: that the land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, vomit you not out.
Leviticus 20:23	And ye shall not walk in the customs of the nation, which I cast out before you: for they did all these things, and therefore I abhorred them.
Leviticus 20:24	But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give it unto you to possess it, a land flowing with milk and honey: I am the LORD your God, which have separated you from the peoples.
Leviticus 20:25	Ye shall therefore separate between the clean beast and the unclean, and between the unclean fowl and the clean: and ye shall not make your souls abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any thing wherewith the ground teemeth, which I have separated from you as unclean.
Leviticus 20:26	And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the LORD am holy, and have separated you from the peoples, that ye should be mine.
Leviticus 20:27	A man also or a woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones: their blood shall be upon them.
Leviticus 21:1	And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto the priests the sons of Aaron, and say unto them, There shall none defile himself for the dead among his people;
Leviticus 21:2	except for his kin, that is near unto him, for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother;
Leviticus 21:3	and for his sister a virgin, that is near unto him, which hath had no husband, for her may he defile himself.
Leviticus 21:4	He shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his people, to profane himself.
Leviticus 21:5	They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh.
Leviticus 21:6	They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of their God: for the offerings of the LORD made by fire, the bread of their God, they do offer: therefore they shall be holy.
Leviticus 21:7	They shall not take a woman that is a harlot, or profane; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband: for he is holy unto his God.
Leviticus 21:8	Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread of thy God: he shall be holy unto thee: for I the LORD, which sanctify you, am holy.
Leviticus 21:9	And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the harlot, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with fire.
Leviticus 21:10	And he that is the high priest among his brethren, upon whose head the anointing oil is poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not let the hair of his head go loose, nor rend his clothes;
Leviticus 21:11	neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother;
Leviticus 21:12	neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him: I am the LORD.
Leviticus 21:13	And he shall take a wife in her virginity.
Leviticus 21:14	A widow, or one divorced, or a profane woman, an harlot, these shall he not take: but a virgin of his own people shall he take to wife.
Leviticus 21:15	And he shall not profane his seed among his people: for I am the LORD which sanctify him.
Leviticus 21:16	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus 21:17	Speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever he be of thy seed throughout their generations that hath a blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God.
Leviticus 21:18	For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or any thing superfluous,
Leviticus 21:19	or a man that is brokenfooted, or brokenhanded,
Leviticus 21:20	or crookbackt, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye, or is scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken;
Leviticus 21:21	no man of the seed of Aaron the priest, that hath a blemish, shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the LORD made by fire: he hath a blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God.
Leviticus 21:22	He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy.
Leviticus 21:23	Only he shall not go in unto the veil, nor come nigh unto the altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries: for I am the LORD which sanctify them.
Leviticus 21:24	So Moses spake unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel.
Leviticus 22:1	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus 22:2	Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, which they hallow unto me, and that they profane not my holy name: I am the LORD.
Leviticus 22:3	Say unto them, Whosoever he be of all your seed throughout your generations, that approacheth unto the holy things, which the children of Israel hallow unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from before me: I am the LORD.
Leviticus 22:4	What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or hath an issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean. And whoso toucheth any thing that is unclean by the dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him;
Leviticus 22:5	or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath;
Leviticus 22:6	the soul which toucheth any such shall be unclean until the even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he bathe his flesh in water.
Leviticus 22:7	And when the sun is down, he shall be clean; and afterward he shall eat of the holy things, because it is his bread.
Leviticus 22:8	That which dieth of itself, or is torn of beasts, he shall not eat to defile himself therewith: I am the LORD.
Leviticus 22:9	They shall therefore keep my charge, lest they bear sin for it, and die therein, if they profane it: I am the LORD which sanctify them.
Leviticus 22:10	There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of the priest’s, or an hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing.
Leviticus 22:11	But if a priest buy any soul, the purchase of his money, he shall eat of it; and such as are born in his house, they shall eat of his bread.
Leviticus 22:12	And if a priest’s daughter be married unto a stranger, she shall not eat of the heave offering of the holy things.
Leviticus 22:13	But if a priest’s daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and is returned unto her father’s house, as in her youth, she shall eat of her father’s bread: but there shall no stranger eat thereof.
Leviticus 22:14	And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give unto the priest the holy thing.
Leviticus 22:15	And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer unto the LORD;
Leviticus 22:16	and so cause them to bear the iniquity that bringeth guilt, when they eat their holy things: for I am the LORD which sanctify them.
Leviticus 22:17	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus 22:18	Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them, Whosoever he be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that offereth his oblation, whether it be any of their vows, or any of their freewill offerings, which they offer unto the LORD for a burnt offering;
Leviticus 22:19	that ye may be accepted, ye shall offer a male without blemish, of the beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats.
Leviticus 22:20	But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer: for it shall not be acceptable for you.
Leviticus 22:21	And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD to accomplish a vow, or for a freewill offering, of the herd or of the flock, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein.
Leviticus 22:22	Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto the LORD, nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the LORD.
Leviticus 22:23	Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted.
Leviticus 22:24	That which hath its stones bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut, ye shall not offer unto the LORD; neither shall ye do thus in your land.
Leviticus 22:25	Neither from the hand of a foreigner shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these; because their corruption is in them, there is a blemish in them: they shall not be accepted for you.
Leviticus 22:26	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus 22:27	When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for the oblation of an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
Leviticus 22:28	And whether it be cow or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her young both in one day.
Leviticus 22:29	And when ye sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the LORD, ye shall sacrifice it that ye may be accepted.
Leviticus 22:30	On the same day it shall be eaten; ye shall leave none of it until the morning: I am the LORD.
Leviticus 22:31	Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I am the LORD.
Leviticus 22:32	And ye shall not profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel: I am the LORD which hallow you,
Leviticus 22:33	that brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD.
Leviticus 23:1	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus 23:2	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, The set feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are my set feasts.
Leviticus 23:3	Six days shall work be done: but on the seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of work: it is a sabbath unto the LORD in all your dwellings.
Leviticus 23:4	These are the set feasts of the LORD, even holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their appointed season.
Leviticus 23:5	In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, is the LORD’S passover.
Leviticus 23:6	And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the LORD: seven days ye shall eat unleavened bread.
Leviticus 23:7	In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work.
Leviticus 23:8	But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD seven days: in the seventh day is an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work.
Leviticus 23:9	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus 23:10	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring the sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest:
Leviticus 23:11	and he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.
Leviticus 23:12	And in the day when ye wave the sheaf, ye shall offer a he-lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the LORD.
Leviticus 23:13	And the meal offering thereof shall be two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the LORD for a sweet savour: and the drink offering thereof shall be of wine, the fourth part of an hin.
Leviticus 23:14	And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor fresh ears, until this selfsame day, until ye have brought the oblation of your God: it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
Leviticus 23:15	And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven sabbaths shall there be complete:
Leviticus 23:16	even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meal offering unto the LORD.
Leviticus 23:17	Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth parts of an ephah: they shall be of fine flour, they shall be baken with leaven, for firstfruits unto the LORD.
Leviticus 23:18	And ye shall present with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be a burnt offering unto the LORD, with their meal offering, and their drink offerings, even an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.
Leviticus 23:19	And ye shall offer one he-goat for a sin offering, and two he-lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings.
Leviticus 23:20	And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits for a wave offering before the LORD, with the two lambs: they shall be holy to the LORD for the priest.
Leviticus 23:21	And ye shall make proclamation on the selfsame day; there shall be an holy convocation unto you: ye shall do no servile work: it is a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.
Leviticus 23:22	And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleaning of thy harvest: thou shalt leave them for the poor, and for the stranger: I am the LORD your God.
Leviticus 23:23	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus 23:24	Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, in the first day of the month, shall be a solemn rest unto you, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, an holy convocation.
Leviticus 23:25	Ye shall do no servile work: and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
Leviticus 23:26	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus 23:27	Howbeit on the tenth day of this seventh month is the day of atonement: it shall be an holy convocation unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
Leviticus 23:28	And ye shall do no manner of work in that same day: for it is a day of atonement, to make atonement for you before the LORD your God.
Leviticus 23:29	For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from his people.
Leviticus 23:30	And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any manner of work in that same day, that soul will I destroy from among his people.
Leviticus 23:31	Ye shall do no manner of work: it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
Leviticus 23:32	It shall be unto you a sabbath of solemn rest, and ye shall afflict your souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye keep your sabbath.
Leviticus 23:33	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus 23:34	Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto the LORD.
Leviticus 23:35	On the first day shall be an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work.
Leviticus 23:36	Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it is a solemn assembly; ye shall do no servile work.
Leviticus 23:37	These are the set feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, and a meal offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, each on its own day:
Leviticus 23:38	beside the sabbaths of the LORD, and beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill offerings, which ye give unto the LORD.
Leviticus 23:39	Howbeit on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruits of the land, ye shall keep the feast of the LORD seven days: on the first day shall be a solemn rest, and on the eighth day shall be a solemn rest.
Leviticus 23:40	And ye shall take you on the first day the fruit of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God seven days.
Leviticus 23:41	And ye shall keep it a feast unto the LORD seven days in the year: it is a statute for ever in your generations: ye shall keep it in the seventh month.
Leviticus 23:42	Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are homeborn in Israel shall dwell in booths:
Leviticus 23:43	that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.
Leviticus 23:44	And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the set feasts of the LORD.
Leviticus 24:1	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus 24:2	Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure olive oil beaten for the light, to cause a lamp to burn continually.
Leviticus 24:3	Without the veil of the testimony, in the tent of meeting, shall Aaron order it from evening to morning before the LORD continually: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations.
Leviticus 24:4	He shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the LORD continually.
Leviticus 24:5	And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two tenth parts of an ephah shall be in one cake.
Leviticus 24:6	And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure table before the LORD.
Leviticus 24:7	And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it may be to the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
Leviticus 24:8	Every sabbath day he shall set it in order before the LORD continually; it is on the behalf of the children of Israel, an everlasting covenant.
Leviticus 24:9	And it shall be for Aaron and his sons; and they shall eat it in a holy place: for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of the LORD made by fire by a perpetual statute.
Leviticus 24:10	And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel: and the son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp;
Leviticus 24:11	and the son of the Israelitish woman blasphemed the Name, and cursed: and they brought him unto Moses. And his mother’s name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.
Leviticus 24:12	And they put him in ward, that it might be declared unto them at the mouth of the LORD.
Leviticus 24:13	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus 24:14	Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him.
Leviticus 24:15	And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin.
Leviticus 24:16	And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely be put to death; all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the stranger, as the homeborn, when he blasphemeth the name of the LORD, shall be put to death.
Leviticus 24:17	And he that smiteth any man mortally shall surely be put to death;
Leviticus 24:18	and he that smiteth a beast mortally shall make it good: life for life.
Leviticus 24:19	And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour; as he hath done, so shall it be done to him;
Leviticus 24:20	breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be rendered unto him.
Leviticus 24:21	And he that killeth a beast shall make it good: and he that killeth a man shall be put to death.
Leviticus 24:22	Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as for the homeborn: for I am the LORD your God.
Leviticus 24:23	And Moses spake to the children of Israel, and they brought forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stoned him with stones. And the children of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses.
Leviticus 25:1	And the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying,
Leviticus 25:2	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the LORD.
Leviticus 25:3	Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruits thereof;
Leviticus 25:4	but in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of solemn rest for the land, a sabbath unto the LORD: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.
Leviticus 25:5	That which groweth of itself of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, and the grapes of thy undressed vine thou shalt not gather: it shall be a year of solemn rest for the land.
Leviticus 25:6	And the sabbath of the land shall be for food for you; for thee, and for thy servant and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant and for thy stranger that sojourn with thee;
Leviticus 25:7	and for thy cattle, and for the beasts that are in thy land, shall all the increase thereof be for food.
Leviticus 25:8	And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and there shall be unto thee the days of seven sabbaths of years, even forty and nine years.
Leviticus 25:9	Then shalt thou send abroad the loud trumpet on the tenth day of the seventh month; in the day of atonement shall ye send abroad the trumpet throughout all your land.
Leviticus 25:10	And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.
Leviticus 25:11	A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather the grapes in it of the undressed vines.
Leviticus 25:12	For it is a jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field.
Leviticus 25:13	In this year of jubile ye shall return every man unto his possession.
Leviticus 25:14	And if thou sell aught unto thy neighbour, or buy of thy neighbour’s hand, ye shall not wrong one another:
Leviticus 25:15	according to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour, and according unto the number of years of the crops he shall sell unto thee.
Leviticus 25:16	According to the multitude of the years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of the years thou shalt diminish the price of it; for the number of the crops doth he sell unto thee.
Leviticus 25:17	And ye shall not wrong one another; but thou shalt fear thy God: for I am the LORD your God.
Leviticus 25:18	Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.
Leviticus 25:19	And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety.
Leviticus 25:20	And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase:
Leviticus 25:21	then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for the three years.
Leviticus 25:22	And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat of the fruits, the old store; until the ninth year, until her fruits come in, ye shall eat the old store.
Leviticus 25:23	And the land shall not be sold in perpetuity; for the land is mine: for ye are strangers and sojourners with me.
Leviticus 25:24	And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land.
Leviticus 25:25	If thy brother be waxen poor, and sell some of his possession, then shall his kinsman that is next unto him come, and shall redeem that which his brother hath sold.
Leviticus 25:26	And if a man have no one to redeem it, and he be waxen rich and find sufficient to redeem it;
Leviticus 25:27	then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; and he shall return unto his possession.
Leviticus 25:28	But if he be not able to get it back for himself, then that which he hath sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubile: and in the jubile it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession.
Leviticus 25:29	And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; for a full year shall he have the right of redemption.
Leviticus 25:30	And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be made sure in perpetuity to him that bought it, throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubile.
Leviticus 25:31	But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be reckoned with the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubile.
Leviticus 25:32	Nevertheless the cities of the Levites, the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time.
Leviticus 25:33	And if one of the Levites redeem, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the jubile: for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel.
Leviticus 25:34	But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession.
Leviticus 25:35	And if thy brother be waxen poor, and his hand fail with thee; then thou shalt uphold him: as a stranger and a sojourner shall he live with thee.
Leviticus 25:36	Take thou no usury of him or increase; but fear thy God: that thy brother may live with thee.
Leviticus 25:37	Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor give him thy victuals for increase.
Leviticus 25:38	I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, to be your God.
Leviticus 25:39	And if thy brother be waxen poor with thee, and sell himself unto thee; thou shalt not make him to serve as a bondservant:
Leviticus 25:40	as an hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with thee; he shall serve with thee unto the year of jubile:
Leviticus 25:41	then shall he go out from thee, he and his children with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return.
Leviticus 25:42	For they are my servants, which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen.
Leviticus 25:43	Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy God.
Leviticus 25:44	And as for thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have; of the nations that are round about you, of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids.
Leviticus 25:45	Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with you, which they have begotten in your land: and they shall be your possession.
Leviticus 25:46	And ye shall make them an inheritance for your children after you, to hold for a possession; of them shall ye take your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel ye shall not rule, one over another, with rigour.
Leviticus 25:47	And if a stranger or sojourner with thee be waxen rich, and thy brother be waxen poor beside him, and sell himself unto the stranger or sojourner with thee, or to the stock of the stranger’s family:
Leviticus 25:48	after that he is sold he may be redeemed; one of his brethren may redeem him:
Leviticus 25:49	or his uncle, or his uncle’s son, may redeem him, or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be waxen rich, he may redeem himself.
Leviticus 25:50	And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he sold himself to him unto the year of jubile: and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years; according to the time of an hired servant shall he be with him.
Leviticus 25:51	If there be yet many years, according unto them he shall give back the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.
Leviticus 25:52	And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile, then he shall reckon with him; according unto his years shall he give back the price of his redemption.
Leviticus 25:53	As a servant hired year by year shall he be with him: he shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight.
Leviticus 25:54	And if he be not redeemed by these means, then he shall go out in the year of jubile, he, and his children with him.
Leviticus 25:55	For unto me the children of Israel are servants; they are my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.
Leviticus 26:1	Ye shall make you no idols, neither shall ye rear you up a graven image, or a pillar, neither shall ye place any figured stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I am the LORD your God.
Leviticus 26:2	Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD.
Leviticus 26:3	If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;
Leviticus 26:4	then I will give your rains in their season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.
Leviticus 26:5	And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.
Leviticus 26:6	And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.
Leviticus 26:7	And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.
Leviticus 26:8	And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall chase ten thousand: and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.
Leviticus 26:9	And I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you; and will establish my covenant with you.
Leviticus 26:10	And ye shall eat old store long kept, and ye shall bring forth the old because of the new.
Leviticus 26:11	And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you.
Leviticus 26:12	And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people.
Leviticus 26:13	I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bars of your yoke, and made you go upright.
Leviticus 26:14	But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments;
Leviticus 26:15	and if ye shall reject my statutes, and if your soul abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but break my covenant;
Leviticus 26:16	I also will do this unto you; I will appoint terror over you, even consumption and fever, that shall consume the eyes, and make the soul to pine away: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.
Leviticus 26:17	And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be smitten before your enemies: they that hate you shall rule over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.
Leviticus 26:18	And if ye will not yet for these things hearken unto me, then I will chastise you seven times more for your sins.
Leviticus 26:19	And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass:
Leviticus 26:20	and your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruit.
Leviticus 26:21	And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.
Leviticus 26:22	And I will send the beast of the field among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your ways shall become desolate.
Leviticus 26:23	And if by these things ye will not be reformed unto me, but will walk contrary unto me;
Leviticus 26:24	then will I also walk contrary unto you; and I will smite you, even I, seven times for your sins.
Leviticus 26:25	And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall execute the vengeance of the covenant; and ye shall be gathered together within your cities: and I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.
Leviticus 26:26	When I break your staff of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.
Leviticus 26:27	And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me;
Leviticus 26:28	then I will walk contrary unto you in fury; and I also will chastise you seven times for your sins.
Leviticus 26:29	And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.
Leviticus 26:30	And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your sun-images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols; and my soul shall abhor you.
Leviticus 26:31	And I will make your cities a waste, and will bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours.
Leviticus 26:32	And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.
Leviticus 26:33	And you will I scatter among the nations, and I will draw out the sword after you: and your land shall be a desolation, and your cities shall be a waste.
Leviticus 26:34	Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye be in your enemies’ land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.
Leviticus 26:35	As long as it lieth desolate it shall have rest; even the rest which it had not in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.
Leviticus 26:36	And as for them that are left of you, I will send a faintness into their heart in the lands of their enemies: and the sound of a driven leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as one fleeth from the sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.
Leviticus 26:37	And they shall stumble one upon another, as it were before the sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.
Leviticus 26:38	And ye shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.
Leviticus 26:39	And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies’ lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.
Leviticus 26:40	And they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, in their trespass which they trespassed against me, and also that because they have walked contrary unto me,
Leviticus 26:41	I also walked contrary unto them, and brought them into the land of their enemies: if then their uncircumcised heart be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity;
Leviticus 26:42	then will I remember my covenant with Jacob; and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.
Leviticus 26:43	The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them; and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they rejected my judgments, and their soul abhorred my statutes.
Leviticus 26:44	And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the LORD their God:
Leviticus 26:45	but I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God: I am the LORD.
Leviticus 26:46	These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.
Leviticus 27:1	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus 27:2	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall accomplish a vow, the persons shall be for the LORD by thy estimation.
Leviticus 27:3	And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.
Leviticus 27:4	And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels.
Leviticus 27:5	And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
Leviticus 27:6	And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver.
Leviticus 27:7	And if it be from sixty years old and upward; if it be a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
Leviticus 27:8	But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall be set before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to the ability of him that vowed shall the priest value him.
Leviticus 27:9	And if it be a beast, whereof men offer an oblation unto the LORD, all that any man giveth of such unto the LORD shall be holy.
Leviticus 27:10	He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy.
Leviticus 27:11	And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer an oblation unto the LORD, then he shall set the beast before the priest:
Leviticus 27:12	and the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as thou the priest valuest it, so shall it be.
Leviticus 27:13	But if he will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part thereof unto thy estimation.
Leviticus 27:14	And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the LORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.
Leviticus 27:15	And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be his.
Leviticus 27:16	And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD part of the field of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the sowing thereof: the sowing of a homer of barley shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver.
Leviticus 27:17	If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to thy estimation it shall stand.
Leviticus 27:18	But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain unto the year of jubile, and an abatement shall be made from thy estimation.
Leviticus 27:19	And if he that sanctified the field will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him.
Leviticus 27:20	And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more:
Leviticus 27:21	but the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shall be holy unto the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest’s.
Leviticus 27:22	And if he sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath bought, which is not of the field of his possession;
Leviticus 27:23	then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation unto the year of jubile: and he shall give thine estimation in that day, as a holy thing unto the LORD.
Leviticus 27:24	In the year of jubile the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land belongeth.
Leviticus 27:25	And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.
Leviticus 27:26	Only the firstling among beasts, which is made a firstling to the LORD, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox or sheep, it is the LORD’S.
Leviticus 27:27	And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall ransom it according to thine estimation, and shall add unto it the fifth part thereof: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation.
Leviticus 27:28	Notwithstanding, no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto the LORD of all that he hath, whether of man or beast, or of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy unto the LORD.
Leviticus 27:29	None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death.
Leviticus 27:30	And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD’S: it is holy unto the LORD.
Leviticus 27:31	And if a man will redeem aught of his tithe, he shall add unto it the fifth part thereof.
Leviticus 27:32	And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the LORD.
Leviticus 27:33	He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.
Leviticus 27:34	These are the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai.
Numbers 1:1	And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tent of meeting, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying,

Numbers 1:46	even all they that were numbered were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty.
Numbers 1:47	But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not numbered among them.

Numbers 1:49	Only the tribe of Levi thou shalt not number, neither shalt thou take the sum of them among the children of Israel:
Numbers 1:50	but appoint thou the Levites over the tabernacle of the testimony, and over all the furniture thereof, and over all that belongeth to it: they shall bear the tabernacle, and all the furniture thereof; and they shall minister unto it, and shall encamp round about the tabernacle.
Numbers 1:51	And when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall take it down: and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.
Numbers 1:52	And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, according to their hosts.
Numbers 1:53	But the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of the testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel: and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of the testimony.

Numbers 2:17	Then the tent of meeting shall set forward, with the camp of the Levites in the midst of the camps: as they encamp, so shall they set forward, every man in his place, by their standards.
Numbers 2:18	On the west side shall be the standard of the camp of Ephraim according to their hosts: and the prince of the children of Ephraim shall be Elishama the son of Ammihud.

Numbers 5:12	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man’s wife go aside, and commit a trespass against him,
Numbers 5:13	and a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes of her husband, and be kept close, and she be defiled, and there be no witness against her, neither she be taken in the act;
Numbers 5:14	and the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be defiled: or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be not defiled:
Numbers 5:15	then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, and shall bring her oblation for her, the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal; he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense thereon; for it is a meal offering of jealousy, a meal offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance.
Numbers 5:16	And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before the LORD:
Numbers 5:17	and the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take, and put it into the water:

Numbers 5:19	and the priest shall cause her to swear, and shall say unto the woman, If no man have lain with thee, and if thou hast not gone aside to uncleanness, being under thy husband, be thou free from this water of bitterness that causeth the curse:
Numbers 5:20	but if thou hast gone aside, being under thy husband, and if thou be defiled, and some man have lain with thee besides thine husband:
Numbers 5:21	then the priest shall cause the woman to swear with the oath of cursing, and the priest shall say unto the woman, The LORD make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when the LORD doth make thy thigh to fall away, and thy belly to swell;
Numbers 5:22	and this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels, and make thy belly to swell, and thy thigh to fall away: and the woman shall say, Amen, Amen.
Numbers 5:23	And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall blot them out into the water of bitterness:
Numbers 5:24	and he shall make the woman drink the water of bitterness that causeth the curse: and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her and become bitter.
Numbers 5:25	And the priest shall take the meal offering of jealousy out of the woman’s hand, and shall wave the meal offering before the LORD, and bring it unto the altar:
Numbers 5:26	and the priest shall take an handful of the meal offering, as the memorial thereof, and burn it upon the altar, and afterward shall make the woman drink the water.
Numbers 5:27	And when he hath made her drink the water, then it shall come to pass, if she be defiled, and have committed a trespass against her husband, that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her and become bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall fall away: and the woman shall be a curse among her people.

Numbers 6:2	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When either man or woman shall make a special vow, the vow of a Nazirite, to separate himself unto the LORD:
Numbers 6:3	he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink; he shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes, nor eat fresh grapes or dried.
Numbers 6:4	All the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the grape-vine, from the kernels even to the husk.
Numbers 6:5	All the days of his vow of separation there shall no razor come upon his head: until the days be fulfilled, in the which he separateth himself unto the LORD, he shall be holy, he shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow long.
Numbers 6:6	All the days that he separateth himself unto the LORD he shall not come near to a dead body.
Numbers 6:7	He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die: because his separation unto God is upon his head.
Numbers 6:8	All the days of his separation he is holy unto the LORD.
Numbers 6:9	And if any man die very suddenly beside him, and he defile the head of his separation; then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it.
Numbers 6:10	And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tent of meeting:
Numbers 6:11	and the priest shall offer one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, and make atonement for him, for that he sinned by reason of the dead, and shall hallow his head that same day.
Numbers 6:12	And he shall separate unto the LORD the days of his separation, and shall bring a he-lamb of the first year for a guilt offering: but the former days shall be void, because his separation was defiled.
Numbers 6:13	And this is the law of the Nazirite, when the days of his separation are fulfilled: he shall be brought unto the door of the tent of meeting:
Numbers 6:14	and he shall offer his oblation unto the LORD, one he-lamb of the first year without blemish for a burnt offering, and one ewe-lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin offering, and one ram without blemish for peace offerings,
Numbers 6:15	and a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and their meal offering, and their drink offerings.
Numbers 6:16	And the priest shall present them before the LORD, and shall offer his sin offering, and his burnt offering:
Numbers 6:17	and he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD, with the basket of unleavened bread: the priest shall offer also the meal offering thereof, and the drink offering thereof.
Numbers 6:18	And the Nazirite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tent of meeting, and shall take the hair of the head of his separation, and put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of peace offerings.
Numbers 6:19	And the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them upon the hands of the Nazirite, after he hath shaven the head of his separation:
Numbers 6:20	and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the LORD; this is holy for the priest, together with the wave breast and heave thigh: and after that the Nazirite may drink wine.
Numbers 6:21	This is the law of the Nazirite who voweth, and of his oblation unto the LORD for his separation, beside that which he is able to get: according to his vow which he voweth, so he must do after the law of his separation.
Numbers 6:22	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers 6:23	Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel; ye shall say unto them,
Numbers 6:24	The LORD bless thee, and keep thee:
Numbers 6:25	The LORD make his face to shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee:
Numbers 6:26	The LORD lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.
Numbers 6:27	So shall they put my name upon the children of Israel; and I will bless them.

Numbers 8:2	Speak unto Aaron, and say unto him, When thou lightest the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light in front of the candlestick.
Numbers 8:3	And Aaron did so; he lighted the lamps thereof so as to give light in front of the candlestick, as the LORD commanded Moses.

Numbers 8:5	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers 8:6	Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and cleanse them.
Numbers 8:7	And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: sprinkle the water of expiation upon them, and let them cause a razor to pass over all their flesh, and let them wash their clothes, and cleanse themselves.
Numbers 8:8	Then let them take a young bullock, and its meal offering, fine flour mingled with oil, and another young bullock shalt thou take for a sin offering.
Numbers 8:9	And thou shalt present the Levites before the tent of meeting: and thou shalt assemble the whole congregation of the children of Israel:
Numbers 8:10	and thou shalt present the Levites before the LORD: and the children of Israel shall lay their hands upon the Levites:
Numbers 8:11	and Aaron shall offer the Levites before the LORD for a wave offering, on the behalf of the children of Israel, that they may be to do the service of the LORD.
Numbers 8:12	And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks: and offer thou the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, unto the LORD, to make atonement for the Levites.
Numbers 8:13	And thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons, and offer them for a wave offering unto the LORD.
Numbers 8:14	Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children of Israel: and the Levites shall be mine.
Numbers 8:15	And after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the tent of meeting: and thou shalt cleanse them, and offer them for a wave offering.
Numbers 8:16	For they are wholly given unto me from among the children of Israel; instead of all that openeth the womb, even the firstborn of all the children of Israel, have I taken them unto me.
Numbers 8:17	For all the firstborn among the children of Israel are mine, both man and beast: on the day that I smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for myself.
Numbers 8:18	And I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel.
Numbers 8:19	And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the tent of meeting, and to make atonement for the children of Israel: that there be no plague among the children of Israel, when the children of Israel come nigh unto the sanctuary.

Numbers 8:25	and from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the work, and shall serve no more;
Numbers 8:26	but shall minister with their brethren in the tent of meeting, to keep the charge, and shall do no service. Thus shalt thou do unto the Levites touching their charges.
Numbers 9:1	And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying,
Numbers 9:2	Moreover let the children of Israel keep the passover in its appointed season.
Numbers 9:3	In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in its appointed season: according to all the statutes of it, and according to all the ordinances thereof, shall ye keep it.
Numbers 9:4	And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover.
Numbers 9:5	And they kept the passover in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, at even, in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.
Numbers 9:6	And there were certain men, who were unclean by the dead body of a man, so that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day:
Numbers 9:7	and those men said unto him, We are unclean by the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer the oblation of the LORD in its appointed season among the children of Israel?
Numbers 9:8	And Moses said unto them, Stay ye; that I may hear what the LORD will command concerning you.
Numbers 9:9	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers 9:10	Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your generations shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the LORD:
Numbers 9:11	in the second month on the fourteenth day at even they shall keep it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs:
Numbers 9:12	they shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break a bone thereof: according to all the statute of the passover they shall keep it.
Numbers 9:13	But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, that soul shall be cut off from his people: because he offered not the oblation of the LORD in its appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.
Numbers 9:14	And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover unto the LORD; according to the statute of the passover, and according to the ordinance thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one statute, both for the stranger, and for him that is born in the land.
Numbers 9:15	And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, even the tent of the testimony: and at even it was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until morning.
Numbers 9:16	So it was alway: the cloud covered it, and the appearance of fire by night.
Numbers 9:17	And whenever the cloud was taken up from over the Tent, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel encamped.
Numbers 9:18	At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of the LORD they encamped: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they remained encamped.
Numbers 9:19	And when the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed not.
Numbers 9:20	And sometimes the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; then according to the commandment of the LORD they remained encamped, and according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed.
Numbers 9:21	And sometimes the cloud was from evening until morning; and when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they journeyed: or if it continued by day and by night, when the cloud was taken up, they journeyed.
Numbers 9:22	Whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, abiding thereon, the children of Israel remained encamped, and journeyed not: but when it was taken up, they journeyed.
Numbers 9:23	At the commandment of the LORD they encamped, and at the commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the charge of the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.
Numbers 10:1	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers 10:2	Make thee two trumpets of silver; of beaten work shalt thou make them: and thou shalt use them for the calling of the congregation, and for the journeying of the camps.
Numbers 10:3	And when they shall blow with them, all the congregation shall gather themselves unto thee at the door of the tent of meeting.
Numbers 10:4	And if they blow but with one, then the princes, the heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves unto thee.
Numbers 10:5	And when ye blow an alarm, the camps that lie on the east side shall take their journey.
Numbers 10:6	And when ye blow an alarm the second time, the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an alarm for their journeys.
Numbers 10:7	But when the assembly is to be gathered together, ye shall blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm.
Numbers 10:8	And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets; and they shall be to you for a statute for ever throughout your generations.
Numbers 10:9	And when ye go to war in your land against the adversary that oppresseth you, then ye shall sound an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before the LORD your God, and ye shall be saved from your enemies.
Numbers 10:10	Also in the day of your gladness, and in your set feasts, and in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; and they shall be to you for a memorial before your God: I am the LORD your God.

Numbers 10:30	And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine own land, and to my kindred.
Numbers 10:31	And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou shalt be to us instead of eyes.
Numbers 10:32	And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that what good soever the LORD shall do unto us, the same will we do unto thee.
Numbers 10:33	And they set forward from the mount of the LORD three days’ journey; and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them three days’ journey, to seek out a resting place for them.

Numbers 11:1	And the people were as murmurers, speaking evil in the ears of the LORD: and when the LORD heard it, his anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORD burnt among them, and devoured in the uttermost part of the camp.
Numbers 11:2	And the people cried unto Moses; and Moses prayed unto the LORD, and the fire abated.
Numbers 11:3	And the name of that place was called Taberah: because the fire of the LORD burnt among them.
Numbers 11:4	And the mixed multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?
Numbers 11:5	We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt for nought; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick:
Numbers 11:6	but now our soul is dried away; there is nothing at all: we have nought save this manna to look to.
Numbers 11:7	And the manna was like coriander seed, and the appearance thereof as the appearance of bdellium.
Numbers 11:8	The people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in mortars, and seethed it in pots, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.

Numbers 11:12	Have I conceived all this people? have I brought them forth, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing-father carrieth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?
Numbers 11:13	Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.

Numbers 11:16	And the LORD said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the tent of meeting, that they may stand there with thee.
Numbers 11:17	And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone.
Numbers 11:18	And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of the LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in Egypt: therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.
Numbers 11:19	Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days;
Numbers 11:20	but a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: because that ye have rejected the LORD which is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?

Numbers 11:26	But there remained two men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, but had not gone out unto the Tent: and they prophesied in the camp.

Numbers 11:30	And Moses gat him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.
Numbers 11:31	And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, about a day’s journey on this side, and a day’s journey on the other side, round about the camp, and about two cubits above the face of the earth.
Numbers 11:32	And the people rose up all that day, and all the night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp.
Numbers 11:33	While the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the anger of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague.

Numbers 12:3	Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth.
Numbers 12:4	And the LORD spake suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam, Come out ye three unto the tent of meeting. And they three came out.
Numbers 12:5	And the LORD came down in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the door of the Tent, and called Aaron and Miriam: and they both came forth.
Numbers 12:6	And he said, Hear now my words: if there be a prophet among you, I the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision, I will speak with him in a dream.
Numbers 12:7	My servant Moses is not so; he is faithful in all mine house:
Numbers 12:8	with him will I speak mouth to mouth, even manifestly, and not in dark speeches; and the form of the LORD shall he behold: wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant, against Moses?
Numbers 12:9	And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and he departed.
Numbers 12:10	And the cloud removed from over the Tent; and, behold, Miriam was leprous, as white as snow: and Aaron looked upon Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous.

Numbers 13:14	Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.
Numbers 13:15	Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.
Numbers 13:16	These are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun Joshua.
Numbers 13:17	And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto them, Get you up this way by the South, and go up into the mountains:
Numbers 13:18	and see the land, what it is; and the people that dwelleth therein, whether they be strong or weak, whether they be few or many;
Numbers 13:19	and what the land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad; and what cities they be that they dwell in, whether in camps, or in strong holds;
Numbers 13:20	and what the land is, whether it be fat or lean, whether there be wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the firstripe grapes.
Numbers 13:21	So they went up, and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, to the entering in of Hamath.
Numbers 13:22	And they went up by the South, and came unto Hebron; and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were there. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)
Numbers 13:23	And they came unto the valley of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it upon a staff between two; they brought also of the pomegranates, and of the figs.
Numbers 13:24	That place was called the valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the children of Israel cut down from thence.
Numbers 13:25	And they returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days.
Numbers 13:26	And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and shewed them the fruit of the land.
Numbers 13:27	And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it.
Numbers 13:28	Howbeit the people that dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are fenced, and very great: and moreover we saw the children of Anak there.
Numbers 13:29	Amalek dwelleth in the land of the South: and the Hittite, and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, dwell in the mountains: and the Canaanite dwelleth by the sea, and along by the side of Jordan.
Numbers 13:30	And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.
Numbers 13:31	But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we.
Numbers 13:32	And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had spied out unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature.
Numbers 13:33	And there we saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, which come of the Nephilim: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.
Numbers 14:1	And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.
Numbers 14:2	And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this wilderness!
Numbers 14:3	And wherefore doth the LORD bring us unto this land, to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones shall be a prey: were it not better for us to return into Egypt?
Numbers 14:4	And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.
Numbers 14:5	Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.
Numbers 14:6	And Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were of them that spied out the land, rent their clothes:
Numbers 14:7	and they spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to spy it out, is an exceeding good land.
Numbers 14:8	If the LORD delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it unto us; a land which floweth with milk and honey.
Numbers 14:9	Only rebel not against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defence is removed from over them, and the LORD is with us: fear them not.
Numbers 14:10	But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of the LORD appeared in the tent of meeting unto all the children of Israel.
Numbers 14:11	And the LORD said unto Moses, How long will this people despise me? and how long will they not believe in me, for all the signs which I have wrought among them?
Numbers 14:12	I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a nation greater and mightier than they.
Numbers 14:13	And Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear it; for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;
Numbers 14:14	and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: they have heard that thou LORD art in the midst of this people; for thou LORD art seen face to face, and thy cloud standeth over them, and thou goest before them, in a pillar of cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night.
Numbers 14:15	Now if thou shalt kill this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying,
Numbers 14:16	Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness.
Numbers 14:17	And now, I pray thee, let the power of the Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying,
Numbers 14:18	The LORD is slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, upon the third and upon the fourth generation.
Numbers 14:19	Pardon, I pray thee, the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy, and according as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.
Numbers 14:20	And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word:
Numbers 14:21	but in very deed, as I live, and as all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD;
Numbers 14:22	because all those men which have seen my glory, and my signs, which I wrought in Egypt and in the wilderness, yet have tempted me these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice;
Numbers 14:23	surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that despised me see it:
Numbers 14:24	but my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it.
Numbers 14:25	Now the Amalekite and the Canaanite dwell in the valley: tomorrow turn ye, and get you into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.
Numbers 14:26	And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
Numbers 14:27	How long shall I bear with this evil congregation, which murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me.
Numbers 14:28	Say unto them, As I live, saith the LORD, surely as ye have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you:
Numbers 14:29	your carcases shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, which have murmured against me,
Numbers 14:30	surely ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I lifted up my hand that I would make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.
Numbers 14:31	But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have rejected.
Numbers 14:32	But as for you, your carcases shall fall in this wilderness.
Numbers 14:33	And your children shall be wanderers in the wilderness forty years, and shall bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be consumed in the wilderness.
Numbers 14:34	After the number of the days in which ye spied out the land, even forty days, for every day a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even forty years, and ye shall know my alienation.
Numbers 14:35	I the LORD have spoken, surely this will I do unto all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.
Numbers 14:36	And the men, which Moses sent to spy out the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up an evil report against the land,
Numbers 14:37	even those men that did bring up an evil report of the land, died by the plague before the LORD.
Numbers 14:38	But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, remained alive of those men that went to spy out the land.
Numbers 14:39	And Moses told these words unto all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly.
Numbers 14:40	And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up to the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we be here, and will go up unto the place which the LORD hath promised: for we have sinned.
Numbers 14:41	And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the LORD, seeing it shall not prosper?
Numbers 14:42	Go not up, for the LORD is not among you; that ye be not smitten down before your enemies.
Numbers 14:43	For there the Amalekite and the Canaanite are before you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned back from following the LORD, therefore the LORD will not be with you.
Numbers 14:44	But they presumed to go up to the top of the mountain: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the camp.
Numbers 14:45	Then the Amalekite came down, and the Canaanite which dwelt in that mountain, and smote them and beat them down, even unto Hormah.
Numbers 15:1	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers 15:2	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land of your habitations, which I give unto you,
Numbers 15:3	and will make an offering by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, or a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or as a freewill offering, or in your set feasts, to make a sweet savour unto the LORD, of the herd, or of the flock:
Numbers 15:4	then shall he that offereth his oblation offer unto the LORD a meal offering of a tenth part of an ephah of fine flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of oil:
Numbers 15:5	and wine for the drink offering, the fourth part of an hin, shalt thou prepare with the burnt offering or for the sacrifice, for each lamb.
Numbers 15:6	Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a meal offering two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oil:
Numbers 15:7	and for the drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of an hin of wine, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.
Numbers 15:8	And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering, or for a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or for peace offerings unto the LORD:
Numbers 15:9	then shall he offer with the bullock a meal offering of three tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour mingled with half an hin of oil.
Numbers 15:10	and thou shalt offer for the drink offering half an hin of wine, for an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.
Numbers 15:11	Thus shall it be done for each bullock, or for each ram, or for each of the he-lambs, or of the kids.
Numbers 15:12	According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to every one according to their number.
Numbers 15:13	All that are homeborn shall do these things after this manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.
Numbers 15:14	And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever be among you throughout your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD; as ye do, so he shall do.
Numbers 15:15	For the assembly, there shall be one statute for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you, a statute for ever throughout your generations: as ye are, so shall the stranger be before the LORD.
Numbers 15:16	One law and one ordinance shall be for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you.
Numbers 15:17	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers 15:18	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land whither I bring you,
Numbers 15:19	then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the LORD.
Numbers 15:20	Of the first of your dough ye shall offer up a cake for an heave offering: as ye do the heave offering of the threshing-floor, so shall ye heave it.
Numbers 15:21	Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the LORD an heave offering throughout your generations.
Numbers 15:22	And when ye shall err, and not observe all these commandments, which the LORD hath spoken unto Moses,
Numbers 15:23	even all that the LORD hath commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day that the LORD gave commandment, and onward throughout your generations;
Numbers 15:24	then it shall be, if it be done unwittingly, without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour unto the LORD, with the meal offering thereof, and the drink offering thereof, according to the ordinance, and one he-goat for a sin offering.
Numbers 15:25	And the priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and they shall be forgiven; for it was an error, and they have brought their oblation, an offering made by fire unto the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD, for their error:
Numbers 15:26	and all the congregation of the children of Israel shall be forgiven, and the stranger that sojourneth among them; for in respect of all the people it was done unwittingly.
Numbers 15:27	And if one person sin unwittingly, then he shall offer a she-goat of the first year for a sin offering.
Numbers 15:28	And the priest shall make atonement for the soul that erreth, when he sinneth unwittingly, before the LORD, to make atonement for him; and he shall be forgiven.
Numbers 15:29	Ye shall have one law for him that doeth aught unwittingly, for him that is homeborn among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them.
Numbers 15:30	But the soul that doeth aught with an high hand, whether he be homeborn or a stranger, the same blasphemeth the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.
Numbers 15:31	Because he hath despised the word of the LORD, and hath broken his commandment; that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him.
Numbers 15:32	And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks upon the sabbath day.
Numbers 15:33	And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation.
Numbers 15:34	And they put him in ward, because it had not been declared what should be done to him.
Numbers 15:35	And the LORD said unto Moses, The man shall surely be put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.
Numbers 15:36	And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died; as the LORD commanded Moses.
Numbers 15:37	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers 15:38	Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of each border a cord of blue:
Numbers 15:39	and it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the LORD, and do them; and that ye go not about after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go a whoring:
Numbers 15:40	that ye may remember and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God.
Numbers 15:41	I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD your God.
Numbers 16:1	Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, with Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men:
Numbers 16:2	and they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the congregation, called to the assembly, men of renown:
Numbers 16:3	and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them, Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the LORD is among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the assembly of the LORD?
Numbers 16:4	And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face:
Numbers 16:5	and he spake unto Korah and unto all his company, saying, In the morning the LORD will shew who are his, and who is holy, and will cause him to come near unto him: even him whom he shall choose will he cause to come near unto him.
Numbers 16:6	This do; take you censers, Korah, and all his company;
Numbers 16:7	and put fire therein, and put incense upon them before the LORD tomorrow: and it shall be that the man whom the LORD doth choose, he shall be holy: ye take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi.
Numbers 16:8	And Moses said unto Korah, Hear now, ye sons of Levi:
Numbers 16:9	seemeth it but a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself; to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them;
Numbers 16:10	and that he hath brought thee near, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee? and seek ye the priesthood also?
Numbers 16:11	Therefore thou and all thy company are gathered together against the LORD: and Aaron, what is he that ye murmur against him?
Numbers 16:12	And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab: and they said, We will not come up:
Numbers 16:13	is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, but thou must needs make thyself also a prince over us?
Numbers 16:14	Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up.
Numbers 16:15	And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the LORD, Respect not thou their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one of them.
Numbers 16:16	And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy congregation before the LORD, thou, and they, and Aaron, tomorrow:
Numbers 16:17	and take ye every man his censer, and put incense upon them, and bring ye before the LORD every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou also, and Aaron, each his censer.
Numbers 16:18	And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood at the door of the tent of meeting with Moses and Aaron.
Numbers 16:19	And Korah assembled all the congregation against them unto the door of the tent of meeting: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the congregation.
Numbers 16:20	And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
Numbers 16:21	Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.
Numbers 16:22	And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation?
Numbers 16:23	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers 16:24	Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.
Numbers 16:25	And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him.
Numbers 16:26	And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed in all their sins.
Numbers 16:27	So they gat them up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood at the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little ones.
Numbers 16:28	And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me to do all these works; for I have not done them of mine own mind.
Numbers 16:29	If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; then the LORD hath not sent me.
Numbers 16:30	But if the LORD make a new thing, and the ground open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go down alive into the pit; then ye shall understand that these men have despised the LORD.
Numbers 16:31	And it came to pass, as he made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that was under them:
Numbers 16:32	and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods.
Numbers 16:33	So they, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the pit: and the earth closed upon them, and they perished from among the assembly.
Numbers 16:34	And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up.
Numbers 16:35	And fire came forth from the LORD, and devoured the two hundred and fifty men that offered the incense.
Numbers 16:36	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers 16:37	Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are holy;
Numbers 16:38	even the censers of these sinners against their own lives, and let them be made beaten plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered them before the LORD, therefore they are holy: and they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel.
Numbers 16:39	And Eleazar the priest took the brasen censers, which they that were burnt had offered; and they beat them out for a covering of the altar:
Numbers 16:40	to be a memorial unto the children of Israel, to the end that no stranger, which is not of the seed of Aaron, come near to burn incense before the LORD; that he be not as Korah, and as his company: as the LORD spake unto him by the hand of Moses.
Numbers 16:41	But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of the LORD.
Numbers 16:42	And it came to pass, when the congregation was assembled against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tent of meeting: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the LORD appeared.
Numbers 16:43	And Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting.
Numbers 16:44	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers 16:45	Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment. And they fell upon their faces.
Numbers 16:46	And Moses said unto Aaron, Take thy censer, and put fire therein from off the altar, and lay incense thereon, and carry it quickly unto the congregation, and make atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the LORD; the plague is begun.
Numbers 16:47	And Aaron took as Moses spake, and ran into the midst of the assembly; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put on the incense, and made atonement for the people.
Numbers 16:48	And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.
Numbers 16:49	Now they that died by the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides them that died about the matter of Korah.
Numbers 16:50	And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tent of meeting: and the plague was stayed.
Numbers 17:1	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers 17:2	Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of them rods, one for each fathers’ house, of all their princes according to their fathers’ houses, twelve rods: write thou every man’s name upon his rod.
Numbers 17:3	And thou shalt write Aaron’s name upon the rod of Levi: for there shall be one rod for each head of their fathers’ houses.
Numbers 17:4	And thou shalt lay them up in the tent of meeting before the testimony, where I meet with you.
Numbers 17:5	And it shall come to pass, that the man whom I shall choose, his rod shall bud: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against you.
Numbers 17:6	And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and all their princes gave him rods, for each prince one, according to their fathers’ houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron was among their rods.
Numbers 17:7	And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tent of the testimony.
Numbers 17:8	And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses went into the tent of the testimony; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and put forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and bare ripe almonds.
Numbers 17:9	And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod.
Numbers 17:10	And the LORD said unto Moses, Put back the rod of Aaron before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the children of rebellion; that thou mayest make an end of their murmurings against me, that they die not.
Numbers 17:11	Thus did Moses: as the LORD commanded him, so did he.
Numbers 17:12	And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we perish, we are undone, we are all undone.
Numbers 17:13	Every one that cometh near, that cometh near unto the tabernacle of the LORD, dieth: shall we perish all of us?
Numbers 18:1	And the LORD said unto Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy fathers’ house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary: and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.
Numbers 18:2	And thy brethren also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou near with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, and minister unto thee: but thou and thy sons with thee shall be before the tent of the testimony.
Numbers 18:3	And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the Tent: only they shall not come nigh unto the vessels of the sanctuary and unto the altar, that they die not, neither they, nor ye.
Numbers 18:4	And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the tent of meeting, for all the service of the Tent: and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you.
Numbers 18:5	And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar: that there be wrath no more upon the children of Israel.
Numbers 18:6	And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel: to you they are a gift, given unto the LORD, to do the service of the tent of meeting.
Numbers 18:7	And thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priesthood for every thing of the altar, and for that within the veil; and ye shall serve: I give you the priesthood as a service of gift: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.
Numbers 18:8	And the LORD spake unto Aaron, And I, behold, I have given thee the charge of mine heave offerings, even all the hallowed things of the children of Israel, unto thee have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, as a due for ever.
Numbers 18:9	This shall be thine of the most holy things, reserved from the fire: every oblation of theirs, even every meal offering of theirs, and every sin offering of theirs, and every guilt offering of theirs, which they shall render unto me, shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons.
Numbers 18:10	As the most holy things shalt thou eat thereof: every male shall eat thereof; it shall be holy unto thee.
Numbers 18:11	And this is thine; the heave offering of their gift, even all the wave offerings of the children of Israel: I have given them unto thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, as a due for ever: every one that is clean in thy house shall eat thereof.
Numbers 18:12	All the best of the oil, and all the best of the vintage, and of the corn, the firstfruits of them which they give unto the LORD, to thee have I given them.
Numbers 18:13	The firstripe fruits of all that is in their land, which they bring unto the LORD, shall be thine; every one that is clean in thy house shall eat thereof.
Numbers 18:14	Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine.
Numbers 18:15	Every thing that openeth the womb, of all flesh which they offer unto the LORD, both of man and beast, shall be thine: nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem.
Numbers 18:16	And those that are to be redeemed of them from a month old shalt thou redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary (the same is twenty gerahs).
Numbers 18:17	But the firstling of an ox, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy: thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet savour unto the LORD.
Numbers 18:18	And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave breast and as the right thigh, it shall be thine.
Numbers 18:19	All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer unto the LORD, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy daughters with thee, as a due for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before the LORD unto thee and to thy seed with thee.
Numbers 18:20	And the LORD said unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any portion among them: I am thy portion and thine inheritance among the children of Israel.
Numbers 18:21	And unto the children of Levi, behold, I have given all the tithe in Israel for an inheritance, in return for their service which they serve, even the service of the tent of meeting.
Numbers 18:22	And henceforth the children of Israel shall not come nigh the tent of meeting, lest they bear sin, and die.
Numbers 18:23	But the Levites shall do the service of the tent of meeting, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations, and among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.
Numbers 18:24	For the tithe of the children of Israel, which they offer as an heave offering unto the LORD, I have given to the Levites for an inheritance: therefore I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.
Numbers 18:25	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers 18:26	Moreover thou shalt speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithe which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the LORD, a tithe of the tithe.
Numbers 18:27	And your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, as though it were the corn of the threshing-floor, and as the fulness of the winepress.
Numbers 18:28	Thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the LORD of all your tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and thereof ye shall give the LORD’S heave offering to Aaron the priest.
Numbers 18:29	Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the LORD, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of it.
Numbers 18:30	Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye heave the best thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the increase of the threshing-floor, and as the increase of the winepress.
Numbers 18:31	And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for it is your reward in return for your service in the tent of meeting.
Numbers 18:32	And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved from it the best thereof: and ye shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, that ye die not.
Numbers 19:1	And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
Numbers 19:2	This is the statute of the law which the LORD hath commanded, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red heifer without spot, wherein is no blemish, and upon which never came yoke:
Numbers 19:3	and ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, and he shall bring her forth without the camp, and one shall slay her before his face:
Numbers 19:4	and Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle of her blood toward the front of the tent of meeting seven times:
Numbers 19:5	and one shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn:
Numbers 19:6	and the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.
Numbers 19:7	Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the even.
Numbers 19:8	And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even.
Numbers 19:9	And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up without the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of separation: it is a sin offering.
Numbers 19:10	And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be unto the children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them, for a statute for ever.
Numbers 19:11	He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days:
Numbers 19:12	the same shall purify himself therewith on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean.
Numbers 19:13	Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet upon him.
Numbers 19:14	This is the law when a man dieth in a tent: every one that cometh into the tent, and every one that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.
Numbers 19:15	And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, is unclean.
Numbers 19:16	And whosoever in the open field toucheth one that is slain with a sword, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.
Numbers 19:17	And for the unclean they shall take of the ashes of the burning of the sin offering, and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel:
Numbers 19:18	and a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that touched the bone, or the slain, or the dead, or the grave:
Numbers 19:19	and the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purify him; and he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at even.
Numbers 19:20	But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from the midst of the assembly, because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the LORD: the water of separation hath not been sprinkled upon him; he is unclean.
Numbers 19:21	And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them: and he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even.
Numbers 19:22	And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean; and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even.
Numbers 20:1	And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came into the wilderness of Zin in the first month: and the people abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.
Numbers 20:2	And there was no water for the congregation: and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.
Numbers 20:3	And the people strove with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God that we had died when our brethren died before the LORD!
Numbers 20:4	And why have ye brought the assembly of the LORD into this wilderness, that we should die there, we and our cattle?
Numbers 20:5	And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place? it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink.
Numbers 20:6	And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tent of meeting, and fell upon their faces: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto them.
Numbers 20:7	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers 20:8	Take the rod, and assemble the congregation, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes, that it give forth its water; and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give the congregation and their cattle drink.
Numbers 20:9	And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded him.
Numbers 20:10	And Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; shall we bring you forth water out of this rock?
Numbers 20:11	And Moses lifted up his hand, and smote the rock with his rod twice: and water came forth abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their cattle.
Numbers 20:12	And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed not in me, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them.
Numbers 20:13	These are the waters of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with the LORD, and he was sanctified in them.
Numbers 20:14	And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us:
Numbers 20:15	how our fathers went down into Egypt, and we dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians evil entreated us, and our fathers:
Numbers 20:16	and when we cried unto the LORD, he heard our voice, and sent an angel, and brought us forth out of Egypt: and, behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border:
Numbers 20:17	let us pass, I pray thee, through thy land: we will not pass through field or through vineyard, neither will we drink of the water of the wells: we will go along the king’s high way, we will not turn aside to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy border.
Numbers 20:18	And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass through me, lest I come out with the sword against thee.
Numbers 20:19	And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go up by the highway: and if we drink of thy water, I and my cattle, then will I give the price thereof: let me only, without doing any thing else, pass through on my feet.
Numbers 20:20	And he said, Thou shalt not pass through. And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand.
Numbers 20:21	Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: wherefore Israel turned away from him.
Numbers 20:22	And they journeyed from Kadesh: and the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came unto mount Hor.
Numbers 20:23	And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the border of the land of Edom, saying,
Numbers 20:24	Aaron shall be gathered unto his people: for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the waters of Meribah.
Numbers 20:25	Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount Hor:
Numbers 20:26	and strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people, and shall die there.
Numbers 20:27	And Moses did as the LORD commanded: and they went up into mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.
Numbers 20:28	And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount.
Numbers 20:29	And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they wept for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.
Numbers 21:1	And the Canaanite, the king of Arad, which dwelt in the South, heard tell that Israel came by the way of Atharim; and he fought against Israel, and took some of them captive.
Numbers 21:2	And Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.
Numbers 21:3	And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and the name of the place was called Hormah.
Numbers 21:4	And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way to the Red Sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.
Numbers 21:5	And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, and there is no water; and our soul loatheth this light bread.
Numbers 21:6	And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.
Numbers 21:7	And the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, because we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray unto the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.
Numbers 21:8	And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a standard: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he seeth it, shall live.
Numbers 21:9	And Moses made a serpent of brass, and set it upon the standard: and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he looked unto the serpent of brass, he lived.
Numbers 21:10	And the children of Israel journeyed, and pitched in Oboth.
Numbers 21:11	And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Iye-abarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising.
Numbers 21:12	From thence they journeyed, and pitched in the valley of Zered.
Numbers 21:13	From thence they journeyed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which is in the wilderness, that cometh out of the border of the Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.
Numbers 21:14	Wherefore it is said in the book of the Wars of the LORD, Vaheb in Suphah, And the valleys of Arnon,
Numbers 21:15	And the slope of the valleys That inclineth toward the dwelling of Ar, And leaneth upon the border of Moab.
Numbers 21:16	And from thence they journeyed to Beer: that is the well whereof the LORD said unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water.
Numbers 21:17	Then sang Israel this song: Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it:
Numbers 21:18	The well, which the princes digged, Which the nobles of the people delved, With the sceptre, and with their staves. And from the wilderness they journeyed to Mattanah:
Numbers 21:19	and from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth:
Numbers 21:20	and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the field of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh down upon the desert.
Numbers 21:21	And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,
Numbers 21:22	Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn aside into field, or into vineyard; we will not drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the king’s high way, until we have passed thy border.
Numbers 21:23	And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness, and came to Jahaz: and he fought against Israel.
Numbers 21:24	And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.
Numbers 21:25	And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the towns thereof.
Numbers 21:26	For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto Arnon.
Numbers 21:27	Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come ye to Heshbon, Let the city of Sihon be built and established:
Numbers 21:28	For a fire is gone out of Heshbon, A flame from the city of Sihon: It hath devoured Ar of Moab, The lords of the high places of Arnon.
Numbers 21:29	Woe to thee, Moab! Thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: He hath given his sons as fugitives, And his daughters into captivity, Unto Sihon king of the Amorites.
Numbers 21:30	We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, And we have laid waste even unto Nophah, Which reacheth unto Medeba.
Numbers 21:31	Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.
Numbers 21:32	And Moses sent to spy out Jazer, and they took the towns thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there.
Numbers 21:33	And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.
Numbers 21:34	And the LORD said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.
Numbers 21:35	So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left him remaining: and they possessed his land.
Numbers 22:1	And the children of Israel journeyed, and pitched in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan at Jericho.
Numbers 22:2	And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.
Numbers 22:3	And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.
Numbers 22:4	And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this multitude lick up all that is round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time.
Numbers 22:5	And he sent messengers unto Balaam the son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the River, to the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me:
Numbers 22:6	come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land: for I know that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.
Numbers 22:7	And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak.
Numbers 22:8	And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the LORD shall speak unto me: and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam.
Numbers 22:9	And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with thee?
Numbers 22:10	And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me, saying,
Numbers 22:11	Behold, the people that is come out of Egypt, it covereth the face of the earth: now, come curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to fight against them, and shall drive them out.
Numbers 22:12	And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people: for they are blessed.
Numbers 22:13	And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to give me leave to go with you.
Numbers 22:14	And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.
Numbers 22:15	And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they.
Numbers 22:16	And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me:
Numbers 22:17	for I will promote thee unto very great honour, and whatsoever thou sayest unto me I will do: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people.
Numbers 22:18	And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.
Numbers 22:19	Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will speak unto me more.
Numbers 22:20	And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men be come to call thee, rise up, go with them; but only the word which I speak unto thee, that shalt thou do.
Numbers 22:21	And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.
Numbers 22:22	And God’s anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD placed himself in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.
Numbers 22:23	And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.
Numbers 22:24	Then the angel of the LORD stood in a hollow way between the vineyards, a fence being on this side, and a fence on that side.
Numbers 22:25	And the ass saw the angel of the LORD, and she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam’s foot against the wall: and he smote her again.
Numbers 22:26	And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.
Numbers 22:27	And the ass saw the angel of the LORD, and she lay down under Balaam: and Balaam’s anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with his staff.
Numbers 22:28	And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?
Numbers 22:29	And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now I had killed thee.
Numbers 22:30	And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden all thy life long unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay.
Numbers 22:31	Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed his head, and fell on his face.
Numbers 22:32	And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I am come forth for an adversary, because thy way is perverse before me:
Numbers 22:33	and the ass saw me, and turned aside before me these three times: unless she had turned aside from me, surely now I had even slain thee, and saved her alive.
Numbers 22:34	And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again.
Numbers 22:35	And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.
Numbers 22:36	And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto the City of Moab, which is on the border of Arnon, which is in the utmost part of the border.
Numbers 22:37	And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour?
Numbers 22:38	And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to speak any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.
Numbers 22:39	And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kiriath-huzoth.
Numbers 22:40	And Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him.
Numbers 22:41	And it came to pass in the morning, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, and he saw from thence the utmost part of the people.
Numbers 23:1	And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.
Numbers 23:2	And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram.
Numbers 23:3	And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I will go; peradventure the LORD will come to meet me: and whatsoever he sheweth me I will tell thee. And he went to a bare height.
Numbers 23:4	And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.
Numbers 23:5	And the LORD put a word in Balaam’s mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.
Numbers 23:6	And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt offering, he, and all the princes of Moab.
Numbers 23:7	And he took up his parable, and said, From Aram hath Balak brought me, The king of Moab from the mountains of the East: Come, curse me Jacob, And come, defy Israel.
Numbers 23:8	How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? And how shall I defy, whom the LORD hath not defied?
Numbers 23:9	For from the top of the rocks I see him, And from the hills I behold him: Lo, it is a people that dwell alone, And shall not be reckoned among the nations.
Numbers 23:10	Who can count the dust of Jacob, Or number the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, And let my last end be like his!
Numbers 23:11	And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed them altogether.
Numbers 23:12	And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which the LORD putteth in my mouth?
Numbers 23:13	And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see them; thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: and curse me them from thence.
Numbers 23:14	And he took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.
Numbers 23:15	And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering, while I meet the LORD yonder.
Numbers 23:16	And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus shalt thou speak.
Numbers 23:17	And he came to him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath the LORD spoken?
Numbers 23:18	And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; Hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor:
Numbers 23:19	God is not a man, that he should lie; Neither the son of man, that he should repent: Hath he said, and shall he not do it? Or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?
Numbers 23:20	Behold, I have received commandment to bless: And he hath blessed, and I cannot reverse it.
Numbers 23:21	He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, Neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel: The LORD his God is with him, And the shout of a king is among them.
Numbers 23:22	God bringeth them forth out of Egypt; He hath as it were the strength of the wild-ox.
Numbers 23:23	Surely there is no enchantment with Jacob, Neither is there any divination with Israel: Now shall it be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!
Numbers 23:24	Behold, the people riseth up as a lioness, And as a lion doth he lift himself up: He shall not lie down until he eat of the prey, And drink the blood of the slain.
Numbers 23:25	And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.
Numbers 23:26	But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee, saying, All that the LORD speaketh, that I must do?
Numbers 23:27	And Balak said unto Balaam, Come now, I will take thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence.
Numbers 23:28	And Balak took Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh down upon the desert.
Numbers 23:29	And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.
Numbers 23:30	And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.
Numbers 24:1	And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he went not, as at the other times, to meet with enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness.
Numbers 24:2	And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel dwelling according to their tribes; and the spirit of God came upon him.
Numbers 24:3	And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor saith, And the man whose eye was closed saith:
Numbers 24:4	He saith, which heareth the words of God, Which seeth the vision of the Almighty, Falling down, and having his eyes open:
Numbers 24:5	How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, Thy tabernacles, O Israel!
Numbers 24:6	As valleys are they spread forth, As gardens by the river side, As lign-aloes which the LORD hath planted, As cedar trees beside the waters.
Numbers 24:7	Water shall flow from his buckets, And his seed shall be in many waters, And his king shall be higher than Agag, And his kingdom shall be exalted.
Numbers 24:8	God bringeth him forth out of Egypt; He hath as it were the strength of the wild-ox: He shall eat up the nations his adversaries, And shall break their bones in pieces, And smite them through with his arrows.
Numbers 24:9	He couched, he lay down as a lion, And as a lioness; who shall rouse him up? Blessed be every one that blesseth thee, And cursed be every one that curseth thee.
Numbers 24:10	And Balak’s anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these three times.
Numbers 24:11	Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee unto great honour; but, lo, the LORD hath kept thee back from honour.
Numbers 24:12	And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me, saying,
Numbers 24:13	If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD, to do either good or bad of mine own mind; what the LORD speaketh, that will I speak?
Numbers 24:14	And now, behold, I go unto my people: come, and I will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days.
Numbers 24:15	And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor saith, And the man whose eye was closed saith:
Numbers 24:16	He saith, which heareth the words of God, And knoweth the knowledge of the Most High, Which seeth the vision of the Almighty, Falling down, and having his eyes open:
Numbers 24:17	I see him, but not now: I behold him, but not nigh: There shall come forth a star out of Jacob, And a sceptre shall rise out of Israel, And shall smite through the corners of Moab, And break down all the sons of tumult.
Numbers 24:18	And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession, which were his enemies; While Israel doeth valiantly.

Numbers 25:11	Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, in that he was jealous with my jealousy among them, so that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy.
Numbers 25:12	Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace:

Numbers 30:4	and her father heareth her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father holdeth his peace at her: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.

Numbers 30:14	But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day; then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which are upon her: he hath established them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them.
Numbers 30:15	But if he shall make them null and void after that he hath heard them; then he shall bear her iniquity.
Numbers 30:16	These are the statutes, which the LORD commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between a father and his daughter, being in her youth, in her father’s house.
Numbers 31:1	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers 31:2	Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites: afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people.
Numbers 31:3	And Moses spake unto the people, saying, Arm ye men from among you for the war, that they may go against Midian, to execute the LORD’S vengeance on Midian.
Numbers 31:4	Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, shall ye send to the war.
Numbers 31:5	So there were delivered, out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.
Numbers 31:6	And Moses sent them, a thousand of every tribe, to the war, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the vessels of the sanctuary and the trumpets for the alarm in his hand.
Numbers 31:7	And they warred against Midian, as the LORD commanded Moses; and they slew every male.
Numbers 31:8	And they slew the kings of Midian with the rest of their slain; Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword.
Numbers 31:9	And the children of Israel took captive the women of Midian and their little ones; and all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods, they took for a prey.
Numbers 31:10	And all their cities in the places wherein they dwelt, and all their encampments, they burnt with fire.
Numbers 31:11	And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of man and of beast.
Numbers 31:12	And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto Moses, and unto Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by the Jordan at Jericho.
Numbers 31:13	And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp.
Numbers 31:14	And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, which came from the service of the war.
Numbers 31:15	And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive?
Numbers 31:16	Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor, and so the plague was among the congregation of the LORD.
Numbers 31:17	Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him.
Numbers 31:18	But all the women children, that have not known man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.
Numbers 31:19	And encamp ye without the camp seven days: whosoever hath killed any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain, purify yourselves on the third day and on the seventh day, ye and your captives.
Numbers 31:20	And as to every garment, and all that is made of skin, and all work of goats’ hair, and all things made of wood, ye shall purify yourselves.
Numbers 31:21	And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to the battle, This is the statute of the law which the LORD hath commanded Moses:
Numbers 31:22	howbeit the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead,
Numbers 31:23	every thing that may abide the fire, ye shall make to go through the fire, and it shall be clean; nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of separation: and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make to go through the water.
Numbers 31:24	And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall be clean, and afterward ye shall come into the camp.
Numbers 31:25	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers 31:26	Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the heads of the fathers’ houses of the congregation:
Numbers 31:27	and divide the prey into two parts; between the men skilled in war, that went out to battle, and all the congregation:
Numbers 31:28	and levy a tribute unto the LORD of the men of war that went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the beeves, and of the asses, and of the flocks:
Numbers 31:29	take it of their half, and give it unto Eleazar the priest, for the LORD’S heave offering.
Numbers 31:30	And of the children of Israel’s half, thou shalt take one drawn out of every fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, and of the flocks, even of all the cattle, and give them unto the Levites, which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD.
Numbers 31:31	And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses.
Numbers 31:32	Now the prey, over and above the booty which the men of war took, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep,
Numbers 31:33	and threescore and twelve thousand beeves,
Numbers 31:34	and threescore and one thousand asses,
Numbers 31:35	and thirty and two thousand persons in all, of the women that had not known man by lying with him.
Numbers 31:36	And the half, which was the portion of them that went out to war, was in number three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep:
Numbers 31:37	and the LORD’S tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen.
Numbers 31:38	And the beeves were thirty and six thousand; of which the LORD’S tribute was threescore and twelve.
Numbers 31:39	And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which the LORD’S tribute was threescore and one.
Numbers 31:40	And the persons were sixteen thousand; of whom the LORD’S tribute was thirty and two persons.
Numbers 31:41	And Moses gave the tribute, which was the LORD’S heave offering, unto Eleazar the priest, as the LORD commanded Moses.
Numbers 31:42	And of the children of Israel’s half, which Moses divided off from the men that warred,
Numbers 31:43	(now the congregation’s half was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand, seven thousand and five hundred sheep,
Numbers 31:44	and thirty and six thousand beeves,
Numbers 31:45	and thirty thousand and five hundred asses,
Numbers 31:46	and sixteen thousand persons;)
Numbers 31:47	even of the children of Israel’s half, Moses took one drawn out of every fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them unto the Levites, which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.
Numbers 31:48	And the officers which were over the thousands of the host, the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds, came near unto Moses:
Numbers 31:49	and they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war which are under our charge, and there lacketh not one man of us.
Numbers 31:50	And we have brought the LORD’S oblation, what every man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, ankle chains, and bracelets, signet-rings, earrings, and armlets, to make atonement for our souls before the LORD.
Numbers 31:51	And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even all wrought jewels.
Numbers 31:52	And all the gold of the heave offering that they offered up to the LORD, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.
Numbers 31:53	(For the men of war had taken booty, every man for himself.)
Numbers 31:54	And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tent of meeting, for a memorial for the children of Israel before the LORD.
Numbers 32:1	Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a place for cattle;
Numbers 32:2	the children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spake unto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of the congregation, saying,
Numbers 32:3	Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Sebam, and Nebo, and Beon,
Numbers 32:4	the land which the LORD smote before the congregation of Israel, is a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle.
Numbers 32:5	And they said, If we have found grace in thy sight, let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession; bring us not over Jordan.
Numbers 32:6	And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brethren go to the war, and shall ye sit here?
Numbers 32:7	And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the LORD hath given them?
Numbers 32:8	Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land.
Numbers 32:9	For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which the LORD had given them.
Numbers 32:10	And the LORD’S anger was kindled in that day, and he sware, saying,
Numbers 32:11	Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me:
Numbers 32:12	save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, and Joshua the son of Nun: because they have wholly followed the LORD.
Numbers 32:13	And the LORD’S anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander to and fro in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, that had done evil in the sight of the LORD, was consumed.
Numbers 32:14	And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers’ stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the LORD toward Israel.
Numbers 32:15	For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and ye shall destroy all this people.
Numbers 32:16	And they came near unto him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones:
Numbers 32:17	but we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the children of Israel, until we have brought them unto their place: and our little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land.
Numbers 32:18	We will not return unto our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance.
Numbers 32:19	For we will not inherit with them on the other side Jordan, and forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan eastward.
Numbers 32:20	And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing; If ye will arm yourselves to go before the LORD to the war,
Numbers 32:21	and every armed man of you will pass over Jordan before the LORD, until he hath driven out his enemies from before him,
Numbers 32:22	and the land be subdued before the LORD: then afterward ye shall return, and be guiltless towards the LORD, and towards Israel; and this land shall be unto you for a possession before the LORD.
Numbers 32:23	But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the LORD: and be sure your sin will find you out.
Numbers 32:24	Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth.
Numbers 32:25	And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth.
Numbers 32:26	Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead:
Numbers 32:27	but thy servants will pass over, every man that is armed for war, before the LORD to battle, as my lord saith.
Numbers 32:28	So Moses gave charge concerning them to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers’ houses of the tribes of the children of Israel.
Numbers 32:29	And Moses said unto them, If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every man that is armed to battle, before the LORD, and the land shall be subdued before you; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession:
Numbers 32:30	but if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.
Numbers 32:31	And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, As the LORD hath said unto thy servants, so will we do.
Numbers 32:32	We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan, and the possession of our inheritance shall remain with us beyond Jordan.
Numbers 32:33	And Moses gave unto them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and unto the half tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, according to the cities thereof with their borders, even the cities of the land round about.
Numbers 32:34	And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer;
Numbers 32:35	and Atroth-shophan, and Jazer, and Jogbehah;
Numbers 32:36	and Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran: fenced cities, and folds for sheep.
Numbers 32:37	And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kiriathaim;
Numbers 32:38	and Nebo, and Baal-meon, (their names being changed,) and Sibmah: and gave other names unto the cities which they builded.
Numbers 32:39	And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorites which were therein.
Numbers 32:40	And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh; and he dwelt therein.
Numbers 32:41	And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the towns thereof, and called them Havvoth-jair.
Numbers 32:42	And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and called it Nobah, after his own name.
Numbers 33:1	These are the journeys of the children of Israel, when they went forth out of the land of Egypt by their hosts under the hand of Moses and Aaron.
Numbers 33:2	And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of the LORD: and these are their journeys according to their goings out.
Numbers 33:3	And they journeyed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the passover the children of Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians,

Numbers 33:50	And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,
Numbers 33:51	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye pass over Jordan into the land of Canaan,
Numbers 33:52	then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their figured stones, and destroy all their molten images, and demolish all their high places:
Numbers 33:53	and ye shall take possession of the land, and dwell therein: for unto you have I given the land to possess it.
Numbers 33:54	And ye shall inherit the land by lot according to your families; to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer thou shalt give the less inheritance: wheresoever the lot falleth to any man, that shall be his; according to the tribes of your fathers shall ye inherit.
Numbers 33:55	But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you; then shall those which ye let remain of them be as pricks in your eyes, and as thorns in your sides, and they shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell.
Numbers 33:56	And it shall come to pass, that as I thought to do unto them, so will I do unto you.
Numbers 34:1	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers 34:2	Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land of Canaan, (this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance, even the land of Canaan according to the borders thereof,)
Numbers 34:3	then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the side of Edom, and your south border shall be from the end of the Salt Sea eastward:
Numbers 34:4	and your border shall turn about southward of the ascent of Akrabbim, and pass along to Zin: and the goings out thereof shall be southward of Kadesh-barnea; and it shall go forth to Hazar-addar, and pass along to Azmon:
Numbers 34:5	and the border shall turn about from Azmon unto the brook of Egypt, and the goings out thereof shall be at the sea.
Numbers 34:6	And for the western border, ye shall have the great sea and the border thereof: this shall be your west border.
Numbers 34:7	And this shall be your north border: from the great sea ye shall mark out for you mount Hor:
Numbers 34:8	from mount Hor ye shall mark out unto the entering in of Hamath; and the goings out of the border shall be at Zedad:
Numbers 34:9	and the border shall go forth to Ziphron, and the goings out thereof shall be at Hazar-enan: this shall be your north border.
Numbers 34:10	And ye shall mark out your east border from Hazar-enan to Shepham:
Numbers 34:11	and the border shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain; and the border shall go down, and shall reach unto the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward:
Numbers 34:12	and the border shall go down to Jordan, and the goings out thereof shall be at the Salt Sea: this shall be your land according to the borders thereof round about.
Numbers 34:13	And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This is the land which ye shall inherit by lot, which the LORD hath commanded to give unto the nine tribes, and to the half tribe:
Numbers 34:14	for the tribe of the children of Reuben according to their fathers’ houses, and the tribe of the children of Gad according to their fathers’ houses, have received, and the half tribe of Manasseh have received, their inheritance:
Numbers 34:15	the two tribes and the half tribe have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward, toward the sunrising.
Numbers 34:16	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers 34:17	These are the names of the men which shall divide the land unto you for inheritance: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun.
Numbers 34:18	And ye shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the land for inheritance.
Numbers 34:19	And these are the names of the men: of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.

Numbers 34:29	These are they whom the LORD commanded to divide the inheritance unto the children of Israel in the land of Canaan.
Numbers 35:1	And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,
Numbers 35:2	Command the children of Israel, that they give unto the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and suburbs for the cities round about them shall ye give unto the Levites.
Numbers 35:3	And the cities shall they have to dwell in; and their suburbs shall be for their cattle, and for their substance, and for all their beasts.
Numbers 35:4	And the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give unto the Levites, shall be from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about.
Numbers 35:5	And ye shall measure without the city for the east side two thousand cubits, and for the south side two thousand cubits, and for the west side two thousand cubits, and for the north side two thousand cubits, the city being in the midst. This shall be to them the suburbs of the cities.
Numbers 35:6	And the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites, they shall be the six cities of refuge, which ye shall give for the manslayer to flee thither: and beside them ye shall give forty and two cities.
Numbers 35:7	All the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be forty and eight cities: them shall ye give with their suburbs.
Numbers 35:8	And concerning the cities which ye shall give of the possession of the children of Israel, from the many ye shall take many; and from the few ye shall take few: every one according to his inheritance which he inheriteth shall give of his cities unto the Levites.
Numbers 35:9	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers 35:10	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye pass over Jordan into the land of Canaan,
Numbers 35:11	then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you; that the manslayer which killeth any person unwittingly may flee thither.
Numbers 35:12	And the cities shall be unto you for refuge from the avenger; that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation for judgment.
Numbers 35:13	And the cities which ye shall give shall be for you six cities of refuge.
Numbers 35:14	Ye shall give three cities beyond Jordan, and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan; they shall be cities of refuge.
Numbers 35:15	For the children of Israel, and for the stranger and for the sojourner among them, shall these six cities be for refuge: that every one that killeth any person unwittingly may flee thither.
Numbers 35:16	But if he smote him with an instrument of iron, so that he died, he is a manslayer: the manslayer shall surely be put to death.
Numbers 35:17	And if he smote him with a stone in the hand, whereby a man may die, and he died, he is a manslayer: the manslayer shall surely be put to death.
Numbers 35:18	Or if he smote him with a weapon of wood in the hand, whereby a man may die, and he died, he is a manslayer: the manslayer shall surely be put to death.
Numbers 35:19	The avenger of blood shall himself put the manslayer to death: when he meeteth him, he shall put him to death.
Numbers 35:20	And if he thrust him of hatred, or hurled at him, lying in wait, so that he died;
Numbers 35:21	or in enmity smote him with his hand, that he died: he that smote him shall surely be put to death; he is a manslayer: the avenger of blood shall put the manslayer to death, when he meeteth him.
Numbers 35:22	But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or hurled upon him any thing without lying in wait,
Numbers 35:23	or with any stone, whereby a man may die, seeing him not, and cast it upon him, so that he died, and he was not his enemy, neither sought his harm:
Numbers 35:24	then the congregation shall judge between the smiter and the avenger of blood according to these judgments:
Numbers 35:25	and the congregation shall deliver the manslayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge, whither he was fled: and he shall dwell therein until the death of the high priest, which was anointed with the holy oil.
Numbers 35:26	But if the manslayer shall at any time go beyond the border of his city of refuge, whither he fleeth;
Numbers 35:27	and the avenger of blood find him without the border of his city of refuge, and the avenger of blood slay the manslayer; he shall not be guilty of blood:
Numbers 35:28	because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the manslayer shall return into the land of his possession.
Numbers 35:29	And these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
Numbers 35:30	Whoso killeth any person, the manslayer shall be slain at the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person that he die.
Numbers 35:31	Moreover ye shall take no ransom for the life of a manslayer, which is guilty of death: but he shall surely be put to death.
Numbers 35:32	And ye shall take no ransom for him that is fled to his city of refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest.
Numbers 35:33	So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are: for blood, it polluteth the land: and no expiation can be made for the land for the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.
Numbers 35:34	And thou shalt not defile the land which ye inhabit, in the midst of which I dwell: for I the LORD dwell in the midst of the children of Israel.
Numbers 36:1	And the heads of the fathers’ houses of the family of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spake before Moses, and before the princes, the heads of the fathers’ houses of the children of Israel:
Numbers 36:2	and they said, The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters.
Numbers 36:3	And if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of our fathers, and shall be added to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong: so shall it be taken away from the lot of our inheritance.
Numbers 36:4	And when the jubile of the children of Israel shall be, then shall their inheritance be added unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong: so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.
Numbers 36:5	And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the LORD, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph speaketh right.
Numbers 36:6	This is the thing which the LORD doth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they think best; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry.
Numbers 36:7	So shall no inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe: for the children of Israel shall cleave every one to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.
Numbers 36:8	And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may possess every man the inheritance of his fathers.
Numbers 36:9	So shall no inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe; for the tribes of the children of Israel shall cleave every one to his own inheritance.
Numbers 36:10	Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad:
Numbers 36:11	for Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father’s brothers’ sons.
Numbers 36:12	They were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father.
Numbers 36:13	These are the commandments and the judgments, which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.
Deuteronomy 1:1	These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel beyond Jordan in the wilderness, in the Arabah over against Suph, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Di-zahab.
Deuteronomy 1:2	It is eleven days’ journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadesh-barnea.
Deuteronomy 1:3	And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the LORD had given him in commandment unto them;
Deuteronomy 1:4	after he had smitten Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt in Ashtaroth, at Edrei:
Deuteronomy 1:5	beyond Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,
Deuteronomy 1:6	The LORD our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mountain:
Deuteronomy 1:7	turn you, and take your journey, and go to the hill country of the Amorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the Arabah, in the hill country, and in the lowland, and in the South, and by the sea shore, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates.
Deuteronomy 1:8	Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.
Deuteronomy 1:9	And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:
Deuteronomy 1:10	The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.
Deuteronomy 1:11	The LORD, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times so many more as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!
Deuteronomy 1:12	How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?
Deuteronomy 1:13	Take you wise men, and understanding, and known, according to your tribes, and I will make them heads over you.
Deuteronomy 1:14	And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do.
Deuteronomy 1:15	So I took the heads of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens, and officers, according to your tribes.
Deuteronomy 1:16	And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between a man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.
Deuteronomy 1:17	Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; ye shall hear the small and the great alike; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God’s: and the cause that is too hard for you ye shall bring unto me, and I will hear it.
Deuteronomy 1:18	And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.
Deuteronomy 1:19	And we journeyed from Horeb, and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which ye saw, by the way to the hill country of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadesh-barnea.
Deuteronomy 1:20	And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the hill country of the Amorites, which the LORD our God giveth unto us.
Deuteronomy 1:21	Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up, take possession, as the LORD, the God of thy fathers, hath spoken unto thee; fear not, neither be dismayed.
Deuteronomy 1:22	And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, Let us send men before us, that they may search the land for us, and bring us word again of the way by which we must go up, and the cities unto which we shall come.
Deuteronomy 1:23	And the thing pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one man for every tribe:
Deuteronomy 1:24	and they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and spied it out.
Deuteronomy 1:25	And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which the LORD our God giveth unto us.
Deuteronomy 1:26	Yet ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God:
Deuteronomy 1:27	and ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.
Deuteronomy 1:28	Whither are we going up? our brethren have made our heart to melt, saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great and fenced up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.
Deuteronomy 1:29	Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.
Deuteronomy 1:30	The LORD your God who goeth before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;
Deuteronomy 1:31	and in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came unto this place.
Deuteronomy 1:32	Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God,
Deuteronomy 1:33	who went before you in the way, to seek you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and in the cloud by day.
Deuteronomy 1:34	And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying,
Deuteronomy 1:35	Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see the good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers,
Deuteronomy 1:36	save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, he shall see it; and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children: because he hath wholly followed the LORD.
Deuteronomy 1:37	Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither:
Deuteronomy 1:38	Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage thou him; for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.
Deuteronomy 1:39	Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which this day have no knowledge of good or evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.
Deuteronomy 1:40	But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.
Deuteronomy 1:41	Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us. And ye girded on every man his weapons of war, and were forward to go up into the mountain.
Deuteronomy 1:42	And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.
Deuteronomy 1:43	So I spake unto you, and ye hearkened not; but ye rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and were presumptuous, and went up into the mountain.
Deuteronomy 1:44	And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and beat you down in Seir, even unto Hormah.
Deuteronomy 1:45	And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD hearkened not to your voice, nor gave ear unto you.
Deuteronomy 1:46	So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode there.
Deuteronomy 2:1	Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we compassed mount Seir many days.
Deuteronomy 2:2	And the LORD spake unto me, saying,
Deuteronomy 2:3	Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.
Deuteronomy 2:4	And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the border of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore:
Deuteronomy 2:5	contend not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on: because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession.
Deuteronomy 2:6	Ye shall purchase food of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.
Deuteronomy 2:7	For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the work of thy hand: he hath known thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the LORD thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.
Deuteronomy 2:8	So we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir, from the way of the Arabah from Elath and from Ezion-geber. And we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.
Deuteronomy 2:9	And the LORD said unto me, Vex not Moab, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of his land for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession.
Deuteronomy 2:10	(The Emim dwelt therein aforetime, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim:
Deuteronomy 2:11	these also are accounted Rephaim, as the Anakim; but the Moabites call them Emim.
Deuteronomy 2:12	The Horites also dwelt in Seir aforetime, but the children of Esau succeeded them; and they destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the LORD gave unto them.)
Deuteronomy 2:13	Now rise up, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered.
Deuteronomy 2:14	And the days in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, were thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were consumed from the midst of the camp, as the LORD sware unto them.
Deuteronomy 2:15	Moreover the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from the midst of the camp, until they were consumed.
Deuteronomy 2:16	So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,
Deuteronomy 2:17	that the LORD spake unto me, saying,
Deuteronomy 2:18	Thou art this day to pass over Ar, the border of Moab:
Deuteronomy 2:19	and when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, vex them not, nor contend with them: for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon for a possession: because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession.
Deuteronomy 2:20	(That also is accounted a land of Rephaim: Rephaim dwelt therein aforetime; but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim;
Deuteronomy 2:21	a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim; but the LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead:
Deuteronomy 2:22	as he did for the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day:
Deuteronomy 2:23	and the Avvim which dwelt in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)
Deuteronomy 2:24	Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the valley of Arnon: behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.
Deuteronomy 2:25	This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the peoples that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear the report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.
Deuteronomy 2:26	And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,
Deuteronomy 2:27	Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the highway, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.
Deuteronomy 2:28	Thou shalt sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only let me pass through on my feet;
Deuteronomy 2:29	as the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me; until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us.
Deuteronomy 2:30	But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as at this day.
Deuteronomy 2:31	And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to deliver up Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land.
Deuteronomy 2:32	Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, unto battle at Jahaz.
Deuteronomy 2:33	And the LORD our God delivered him up before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.
Deuteronomy 2:34	And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones; we left none remaining:
Deuteronomy 2:35	only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, with the spoil of the cities which we had taken.
Deuteronomy 2:36	From Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of Arnon, and from the city that is in the valley, even unto Gilead, there was not a city too high for us: the LORD our God delivered up all before us:
Deuteronomy 2:37	only to the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not near; all the side of the river Jabbok, and the cities of the hill country, and wheresoever the LORD our God forbade us.
Deuteronomy 3:1	Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, unto battle at Edrei.
Deuteronomy 3:2	And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I have delivered him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.
Deuteronomy 3:3	So the LORD our God delivered into our hand Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.
Deuteronomy 3:4	And we took all his cities at that time; there was not a city which we took not from them; threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
Deuteronomy 3:5	All these were cities fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside the unwalled towns a great many.
Deuteronomy 3:6	And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones.
Deuteronomy 3:7	But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey unto ourselves.
Deuteronomy 3:8	And we took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites that were beyond Jordan, from the valley of Arnon unto mount Hermon;
Deuteronomy 3:9	(which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir;)
Deuteronomy 3:10	all the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
Deuteronomy 3:11	(For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim; behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbah of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.)
Deuteronomy 3:12	And this land we took in possession at that time: from Aroer, which is by the valley of Arnon, and half the hill country of Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites:
Deuteronomy 3:13	and the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, even all Bashan. (The same is called the land of Rephaim.
Deuteronomy 3:14	Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob, unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites; and called them, even Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth-jair, unto this day.)
Deuteronomy 3:15	And I gave Gilead unto Machir.
Deuteronomy 3:16	And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the valley of Arnon, the middle of the valley, and the border thereof; even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;
Deuteronomy 3:17	the Arabah also, and Jordan and the border thereof, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah eastward.
Deuteronomy 3:18	And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all the men of valour.
Deuteronomy 3:19	But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (I know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you;
Deuteronomy 3:20	until the LORD give rest unto your brethren, as unto you, and they also possess the land which the LORD your God giveth them beyond Jordan: then shall ye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you.
Deuteronomy 3:21	And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou goest over.
Deuteronomy 3:22	Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD your God, he it is that fighteth for you.
Deuteronomy 3:23	And I besought the LORD at that time, saying,
Deuteronomy 3:24	O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy strong hand: for what god is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy mighty acts?
Deuteronomy 3:25	Let me go over, I pray thee, and see the good land that is beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.
Deuteronomy 3:26	But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and hearkened not unto me: and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter.
Deuteronomy 3:27	Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.
Deuteronomy 3:28	But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.
Deuteronomy 3:29	So we abode in the valley over against Beth-peor.
Deuteronomy 4:1	And now, O Israel, hearken unto the statutes and unto the judgments, which I teach you, for to do them; that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which the LORD, the God of your fathers, giveth you.
Deuteronomy 4:2	Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you.
Deuteronomy 4:3	Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baal-peor: for all the men that followed Baal-peor, the LORD thy God hath destroyed them from the midst of thee.
Deuteronomy 4:4	But ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God are alive every one of you this day.
Deuteronomy 4:5	Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the LORD my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the midst of the land whither ye go in to possess it.
Deuteronomy 4:6	Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples, which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.
Deuteronomy 4:7	For what great nation is there, that hath a god so nigh unto them, as the LORD our God is whensoever we call upon him?
Deuteronomy 4:8	And what great nation is there, that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?
Deuteronomy 4:9	Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes saw, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life; but make them known unto thy children and thy children’s children;
Deuteronomy 4:10	the day that thou stoodest before the LORD thy God in Horeb, when the LORD said unto me, Assemble me the people, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they live upon the earth, and that they may teach their children.
Deuteronomy 4:11	And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire unto the heart of heaven, with darkness, cloud, and thick darkness.
Deuteronomy 4:12	And the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of words, but ye saw no form; only ye heard a voice.
Deuteronomy 4:13	And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even the ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone.
Deuteronomy 4:14	And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it.
Deuteronomy 4:15	Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of form on the day that the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire:
Deuteronomy 4:16	lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image in the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female,
Deuteronomy 4:17	the likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the heaven,
Deuteronomy 4:18	the likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water under the earth:
Deuteronomy 4:19	and lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun and the moon and the stars, even all the host of heaven, thou be drawn away and worship them, and serve them, which the LORD thy God hath divided unto all the peoples under the whole heaven.
Deuteronomy 4:20	But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of inheritance, as at this day.
Deuteronomy 4:21	Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and sware that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not go in unto that good land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance:
Deuteronomy 4:22	but I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye shall go over, and possess that good land.
Deuteronomy 4:23	Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image in the form of any thing which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee.
Deuteronomy 4:24	For the LORD thy God is a devouring fire, a jealous God.
Deuteronomy 4:25	When thou shalt beget children, and children’s children, and ye shall have been long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make a graven image in the form of any thing, and shall do that which is evil in the sight of the LORD thy God, to provoke him to anger:
Deuteronomy 4:26	I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall utterly be destroyed.
Deuteronomy 4:27	And the LORD shall scatter you among the peoples, and ye shall be left few in number among the nations, whither the LORD shall lead you away.
Deuteronomy 4:28	And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men’s hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.
Deuteronomy 4:29	But if from thence ye shall seek the LORD thy God, thou shalt find him, if thou search after him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.
Deuteronomy 4:30	When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon thee, in the latter days thou shalt return to the LORD thy God, and hearken unto his voice:
Deuteronomy 4:31	for the LORD thy God is a merciful God; he will not fail thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them.
Deuteronomy 4:32	For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and from the one end of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it?
Deuteronomy 4:33	Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?
Deuteronomy 4:34	Or hath God assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of another nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?
Deuteronomy 4:35	Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD he is God; there is none else beside him.
Deuteronomy 4:36	Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct thee: and upon earth he made thee to see his great fire; and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire.
Deuteronomy 4:37	And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought thee out with his presence, with his great power, out of Egypt;
Deuteronomy 4:38	to drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for an inheritance, as at this day.
Deuteronomy 4:39	Know therefore this day, and lay it to thine heart, that the LORD he is God in heaven above and upon the earth beneath: there is none else.
Deuteronomy 4:40	And thou shalt keep his statutes, and his commandments, which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, for ever.
Deuteronomy 4:41	Then Moses separated three cities beyond Jordan toward the sunrising;
Deuteronomy 4:42	that the manslayer might flee thither, which slayeth his neighbour unawares, and hated him not in time past; and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live:
Deuteronomy 4:43	namely, Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, for the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, for the Manassites.
Deuteronomy 4:44	And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel:
Deuteronomy 4:45	these are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which Moses spake unto the children of Israel, when they came forth out of Egypt;
Deuteronomy 4:46	beyond Jordan, in the valley over against Beth-peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, when they came forth out of Egypt:
Deuteronomy 4:47	and they took his land in possession, and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, which were beyond Jordan toward the sunrising;
Deuteronomy 4:48	from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of Arnon, even unto mount Sion (the same is Hermon),
Deuteronomy 4:49	and all the Arabah beyond Jordan eastward, even unto the sea of the Arabah, under the slopes of Pisgah.
Deuteronomy 5:1	And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O Israel, the statutes and the judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them, and observe to do them.
Deuteronomy 5:2	The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.
Deuteronomy 5:3	The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this day.
Deuteronomy 5:4	The LORD spake with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire,
Deuteronomy 5:5	(I stood between the LORD and you at that time, to shew you the word of the LORD: for ye were afraid because of the fire, and went not up into the mount;) saying,
Deuteronomy 5:6	I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
Deuteronomy 5:7	Thou shalt have none other gods before me.
Deuteronomy 5:8	Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image, the likeness of any form that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:
Deuteronomy 5:9	thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the third and upon the fourth generation of them that hate me;
Deuteronomy 5:10	and shewing mercy unto thousands, of them that love me and keep my commandments.
Deuteronomy 5:11	Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain: for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.
Deuteronomy 5:12	Observe the sabbath day, to keep it holy, as the LORD thy God commanded thee.
Deuteronomy 5:13	Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:
Deuteronomy 5:14	but the seventh day is a sabbath unto the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy manservant nor thy maidservant, nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou.
Deuteronomy 5:15	And thou shalt remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and the LORD thy God brought thee out thence by a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the LORD thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day.
Deuteronomy 5:16	Honour thy father and thy mother, as the LORD thy God commanded thee: that thy days may be long, and that it may go well with thee, upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.
Deuteronomy 5:17	Thou shalt do no murder.
Deuteronomy 5:18	Neither shalt thou commit adultery.
Deuteronomy 5:19	Neither shalt thou steal.
Deuteronomy 5:20	Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour.
Deuteronomy 5:21	Neither shalt thou covet thy neighbour’s wife; neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour’s house, his field, or his manservant, or his maidservant, his ox, or his ass, or any thing that is thy neighbour’s.
Deuteronomy 5:22	These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them upon two tables of stone, and gave them unto me.
Deuteronomy 5:23	And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, while the mountain did burn with fire, that ye came near unto me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders;
Deuteronomy 5:24	and ye said, Behold, the LORD our God hath shewed us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God doth speak with man, and he liveth.
Deuteronomy 5:25	Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, then we shall die.
Deuteronomy 5:26	For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived?
Deuteronomy 5:27	Go thou near, and hear all that the LORD our God shall say: and speak thou unto us all that the LORD our God shall speak unto thee; and we will hear it, and do it.
Deuteronomy 5:28	And the LORD heard the voice of your words, when ye spake unto me; and the LORD said unto me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken unto thee: they have well said all that they have spoken.
Deuteronomy 5:29	Oh that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever!
Deuteronomy 5:30	Go say to them, Return ye to your tents.
Deuteronomy 5:31	But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak unto thee all the commandment, and the statutes, and the judgments, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it.
Deuteronomy 5:32	Ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath commanded you: ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.
Deuteronomy 5:33	Ye shall walk in all the way which the LORD your God hath commanded you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with you, and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess.
Deuteronomy 6:1	Now this is the commandment, the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD your God commanded to teach you, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it:
Deuteronomy 6:2	that thou mightest fear the LORD thy God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son’s son, all the days of thy life; and that thy days may be prolonged.
Deuteronomy 6:3	Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the LORD, the God of thy fathers, hath promised unto thee, in a land flowing with milk and honey.
Deuteronomy 6:4	Hear, O Israel: the LORD our God is one LORD:
Deuteronomy 6:5	and thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.
Deuteronomy 6:6	And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be upon thine heart:
Deuteronomy 6:7	and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.
Deuteronomy 6:8	And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be for frontlets between thine eyes.
Deuteronomy 6:9	And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thy house, and upon thy gates.
Deuteronomy 6:10	And it shall be, when the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee; great and goodly cities, which thou buildedst not,
Deuteronomy 6:11	and houses full of all good things, which thou filledst not, and cisterns hewn out, which thou hewedst not, vineyards and olive trees, which thou plantedst not, and thou shalt eat and be full;
Deuteronomy 6:12	then beware lest thou forget the LORD, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
Deuteronomy 6:13	Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; and him shalt thou serve, and shalt swear by his name.
Deuteronomy 6:14	Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the peoples which are round about you;
Deuteronomy 6:15	for the LORD thy God in the midst of thee is a jealous God; lest the anger of the LORD thy God be kindled against thee, and he destroy thee from off the face of the earth.
Deuteronomy 6:16	Ye shall not tempt the LORD your God, as ye tempted him in Massah.
Deuteronomy 6:17	Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath commanded thee.
Deuteronomy 6:18	And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the LORD: that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers,
Deuteronomy 6:19	to thrust out all thine enemies from before thee, as the LORD hath spoken.
Deuteronomy 6:20	When thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD our God hath commanded you?
Deuteronomy 6:21	then thou shalt say unto thy son, We were Pharaoh’s bondmen in Egypt; and the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand:
Deuteronomy 6:22	and the LORD shewed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his house, before our eyes:
Deuteronomy 6:23	and he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers.
Deuteronomy 6:24	And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the LORD our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as at this day.
Deuteronomy 6:25	And it shall be righteousness unto us, if we observe to do all this commandment before the LORD our God, as he hath commanded us.
Deuteronomy 7:1	When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, and shall cast out many nations before thee, the Hittite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, seven nations greater and mightier than thou;
Deuteronomy 7:2	and when the LORD thy God shall deliver them up before thee, and thou shalt smite them; then thou shalt utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto them:
Deuteronomy 7:3	neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son.
Deuteronomy 7:4	For he will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and he will destroy thee quickly.
Deuteronomy 7:5	But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and hew down their Asherim, and burn their graven images with fire.
Deuteronomy 7:6	For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God: the LORD thy God hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself, above all peoples that are upon the face of the earth.
Deuteronomy 7:7	The LORD did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all peoples:
Deuteronomy 7:8	but because the LORD loveth you, and because he would keep the oath which he sware unto your fathers, hath the LORD brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.
Deuteronomy 7:9	Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God; the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations;
Deuteronomy 7:10	and repayeth them that hate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his face.
Deuteronomy 7:11	Thou shalt therefore keep the commandment, and the statutes, and the judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them.
Deuteronomy 7:12	And it shall come to pass, because ye hearken to these judgments, and keep, and do them, that the LORD thy God shall keep with thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers:
Deuteronomy 7:13	and he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee: he will also bless the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy ground, thy corn and thy wine and thine oil, the increase of thy kine and the young of thy flock, in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee.
Deuteronomy 7:14	Thou shalt be blessed above all peoples: there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle.
Deuteronomy 7:15	And the LORD will take away from thee all sickness; and he will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, upon thee, but will lay them upon all them that hate thee.
Deuteronomy 7:16	And thou shalt consume all the peoples which the LORD thy God shall deliver unto thee; thine eye shall not pity them: neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that will be a snare unto thee.
Deuteronomy 7:17	If thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them?
Deuteronomy 7:18	thou shalt not be afraid of them: thou shalt well remember what the LORD thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt;
Deuteronomy 7:19	the great temptations which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out arm, whereby the LORD thy God brought thee out: so shall the LORD thy God do unto all the peoples of whom thou art afraid.
Deuteronomy 7:20	Moreover the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them, until they that are left, and hide themselves, perish from before thee.
Deuteronomy 7:21	Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the LORD thy God is in the midst of thee, a great God and a terrible.
Deuteronomy 7:22	And the LORD thy God will cast out those nations before thee by little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee.
Deuteronomy 7:23	But the LORD thy God shall deliver them up before thee, and shall discomfit them with a great discomfiture, until they be destroyed.
Deuteronomy 7:24	And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou shalt make their name to perish from under heaven: there shall no man be able to stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them.
Deuteronomy 7:25	The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, nor take it unto thee, lest thou be snared therein: for it is an abomination to the LORD thy God:
Deuteronomy 7:26	and thou shalt not bring an abomination into thine house, and become a devoted thing like unto it: thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a devoted thing.
Deuteronomy 8:1	All the commandment which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers.
Deuteronomy 8:2	And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God hath led thee these forty years in the wilderness, that he might humble thee, to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments, or no.
Deuteronomy 8:3	And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every thing that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live.
Deuteronomy 8:4	Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell, these forty years.
Deuteronomy 8:5	And thou shalt consider in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth his son, so the LORD thy God chasteneth thee.
Deuteronomy 8:6	And thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.
Deuteronomy 8:7	For the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths, springing forth in valleys and hills;
Deuteronomy 8:8	a land of wheat and barley, and vines and fig trees and pomegranates; a land of oil olives and honey;
Deuteronomy 8:9	a land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any thing in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass.
Deuteronomy 8:10	And thou shalt eat and be full, and thou shalt bless the LORD thy God for the good land which he hath given thee.
Deuteronomy 8:11	Beware lest thou forget the LORD thy God, in not keeping his commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command thee this day:
Deuteronomy 8:12	lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly houses, and dwelt therein;
Deuteronomy 8:13	and when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied;
Deuteronomy 8:14	then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the LORD thy God, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage;
Deuteronomy 8:15	who led thee through the great and terrible wilderness, wherein were fiery serpents and scorpions, and thirsty ground where was no water; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint;
Deuteronomy 8:16	who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not; that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end:
Deuteronomy 8:17	and thou say in thine heart, My power and the might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth.
Deuteronomy 8:18	But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God, for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth; that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers, as at this day.
Deuteronomy 8:19	And it shall be, if thou shalt forget the LORD thy God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish.
Deuteronomy 8:20	As the nations which the LORD maketh to perish before you, so shall ye perish; because ye would not hearken unto the voice of the LORD your God.
Deuteronomy 9:1	Hear, O Israel: thou art to pass over Jordan this day, to go in to possess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and fenced up to heaven,
Deuteronomy 9:2	a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say, Who can stand before the sons of Anak?
Deuteronomy 9:3	Know therefore this day, that the LORD thy God is he which goeth over before thee as a devouring fire; he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down before thee: so shalt thou drive them out, and make them to perish quickly, as the LORD hath spoken unto thee.
Deuteronomy 9:4	Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the LORD thy God hath thrust them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the LORD hath brought me in to possess this land: whereas for the wickedness of these nations the LORD doth drive them out from before thee.
Deuteronomy 9:5	Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart, dost thou go in to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that he may establish the word which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
Deuteronomy 9:6	Know therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a stiffnecked people.
Deuteronomy 9:7	Remember, forget thou not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou wentest forth out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against the LORD.
Deuteronomy 9:8	Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, and the LORD was angry with you to have destroyed you.
Deuteronomy 9:9	When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights; I did neither eat bread nor drink water.
Deuteronomy 9:10	And the LORD delivered unto me the two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.
Deuteronomy 9:11	And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant.
Deuteronomy 9:12	And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.
Deuteronomy 9:13	Furthermore the LORD spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:
Deuteronomy 9:14	let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.
Deuteronomy 9:15	So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.
Deuteronomy 9:16	And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your God; ye had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the LORD had commanded you.
Deuteronomy 9:17	And I took hold of the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes.
Deuteronomy 9:18	And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty nights; I did neither eat bread nor drink water; because of all your sin which ye sinned, in doing that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.
Deuteronomy 9:19	For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the LORD was wroth against you to destroy you. But the LORD hearkened unto me that time also.
Deuteronomy 9:20	And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.
Deuteronomy 9:21	And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.
Deuteronomy 9:22	And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, ye provoked the LORD to wrath.
Deuteronomy 9:23	And when the LORD sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.
Deuteronomy 9:24	Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you.
Deuteronomy 9:25	So I fell down before the LORD the forty days and forty nights that I fell down; because the LORD had said he would destroy you.
Deuteronomy 9:26	And I prayed unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
Deuteronomy 9:27	Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin:
Deuteronomy 9:28	lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised unto them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.
Deuteronomy 9:29	Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out by thy great power and by thy stretched out arm.
Deuteronomy 10:1	At that time the LORD said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make thee an ark of wood.
Deuteronomy 10:2	And I will write on the tables the words that were on the first tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark.
Deuteronomy 10:3	So I made an ark of acacia wood, and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in mine hand.
Deuteronomy 10:4	And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the LORD spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the LORD gave them unto me.
Deuteronomy 10:5	And I turned and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the LORD commanded me.
Deuteronomy 10:6	(And the children of Israel journeyed from Beeroth Bene-jaakan to Moserah: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest’s office in his stead.
Deuteronomy 10:7	From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of brooks of water.
Deuteronomy 10:8	At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day.
Deuteronomy 10:9	Wherefore Levi hath no portion nor inheritance with his brethren; the LORD is his inheritance, according as the LORD thy God spake unto him.)
Deuteronomy 10:10	And I stayed in the mount, as at the first time, forty days and forty nights: and the LORD hearkened unto me that time also; the LORD would not destroy thee.
Deuteronomy 10:11	And the LORD said unto me, Arise, take thy journey before the people; and they shall go in and possess the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give unto them.
Deuteronomy 10:12	And now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee, but to fear the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul,
Deuteronomy 10:13	to keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes, which I command thee this day for thy good?
Deuteronomy 10:14	Behold, unto the LORD thy God belongeth the heaven, and the heaven of heavens, the earth, with all that therein is.
Deuteronomy 10:15	Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, even you above all peoples, as at this day.
Deuteronomy 10:16	Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiffnecked.
Deuteronomy 10:17	For the LORD your God, he is God of gods, and Lord of lords, the great God, the mighty, and the terrible, which regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward.
Deuteronomy 10:18	He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment.
Deuteronomy 10:19	Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.
Deuteronomy 10:20	Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve; and to him shalt thou cleave, and by his name shalt thou swear.
Deuteronomy 10:21	He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen.
Deuteronomy 10:22	Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons; and now the LORD thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude.
Deuteronomy 11:1	Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and keep his charge, and his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments, alway.
Deuteronomy 11:2	And know ye this day: for I speak not with your children which have not known, and which have not seen the chastisement of the LORD your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his stretched out arm,
Deuteronomy 11:3	and his signs, and his works, which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land;
Deuteronomy 11:4	and what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red Sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how the LORD hath destroyed them unto this day;
Deuteronomy 11:5	and what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came unto this place;
Deuteronomy 11:6	and what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben; how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and every living thing that followed them, in the midst of all Israel:
Deuteronomy 11:7	but your eyes have seen all the great work of the LORD which he did.
Deuteronomy 11:8	Therefore shall ye keep all the commandment which I command thee this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land, whither ye go over to possess it;
Deuteronomy 11:9	and that ye may prolong your days upon the land, which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed, a land flowing with milk and honey.
Deuteronomy 11:10	For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs:
Deuteronomy 11:11	but the land, whither ye go over to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinketh water of the rain of heaven:
Deuteronomy 11:12	a land which the LORD thy God careth for; the eyes of the LORD thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year.
Deuteronomy 11:13	And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,
Deuteronomy 11:14	that I will give the rain of your land in its season, the former rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil.
Deuteronomy 11:15	And I will give grass in thy fields for thy cattle, and thou shalt eat and be full.
Deuteronomy 11:16	Take heed to yourselves, lest your heart be deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;
Deuteronomy 11:17	and the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and ye perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD giveth you.
Deuteronomy 11:18	Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul; and ye shall bind them for a sign upon your hand, and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes.
Deuteronomy 11:19	And ye shall teach them your children, talking of them, when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.
Deuteronomy 11:20	And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house, and upon thy gates:
Deuteronomy 11:21	that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, upon the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give them, as the days of the heavens above the earth.
Deuteronomy 11:22	For if ye shall diligently keep all this commandment which I command you, to do it; to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cleave unto him;
Deuteronomy 11:23	then will the LORD drive out all these nations from before you, and ye shall possess nations greater and mightier than yourselves.
Deuteronomy 11:24	Every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness, and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even unto the hinder sea shall be your border.
Deuteronomy 11:25	There shall no man be able to stand before you: the LORD your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon, as he hath spoken unto you.
Deuteronomy 11:26	Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse;
Deuteronomy 11:27	the blessing, if ye shall hearken unto the commandments of the LORD your God, which I command you this day:
Deuteronomy 11:28	and the curse, if ye shall not hearken unto the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not known.
Deuteronomy 11:29	And it shall come to pass, when the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou shalt set the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal.
Deuteronomy 11:30	Are they not beyond Jordan, behind the way of the going down of the sun, in the land of the Canaanites which dwell in the Arabah, over against Gilgal, beside the oaks of Moreh?
Deuteronomy 11:31	For ye are to pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and dwell therein.
Deuteronomy 11:32	And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and the judgments which I set before you this day.
Deuteronomy 12:1	These are the statutes and the judgments, which ye shall observe to do in the land which the LORD, the God of thy fathers, hath given thee to possess it, all the days that ye live upon the earth.
Deuteronomy 12:2	Ye shall surely destroy all the places, wherein the nations which ye shall possess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree:
Deuteronomy 12:3	and ye shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and burn their Asherim with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods; and ye shall destroy their name out of that place.
Deuteronomy 12:4	Ye shall not do so unto the LORD your God.
Deuteronomy 12:5	But unto the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there, even unto his habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come:
Deuteronomy 12:6	and thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and the heave offering of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstlings of your herd and of your flock:
Deuteronomy 12:7	and there ye shall eat before the LORD your God, and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your households, wherein the LORD thy God hath blessed thee.
Deuteronomy 12:8	Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes:
Deuteronomy 12:9	for ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which the LORD thy God giveth thee.
Deuteronomy 12:10	But when ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the LORD your God causeth you to inherit, and he giveth you rest from all your enemies round about, so that ye dwell in safety;
Deuteronomy 12:11	then it shall come to pass that the place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there, thither shall ye bring all that I command you; your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the LORD:
Deuteronomy 12:12	and ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God, ye, and your sons, and your daughters, and your menservants, and your maidservants, and the Levite that is within your gates, forasmuch as he hath no portion nor inheritance with you.
Deuteronomy 12:13	Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every place that thou seest:
Deuteronomy 12:14	but in the place which the LORD shall choose in one of thy tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, and there thou shalt do all that I command thee.
Deuteronomy 12:15	Notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh within all thy gates, after all the desire of thy soul, according to the blessing of the LORD thy God which he hath given thee: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the gazelle, and as of the hart.
Deuteronomy 12:16	Only ye shall not eat the blood; thou shalt pour it out upon the earth as water.
Deuteronomy 12:17	Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or of thy wine, or of thine oil, or the firstlings of thy herd or of thy flock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy freewill offerings, nor the heave offering of thine hand:
Deuteronomy 12:18	but thou shalt eat them before the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite that is within thy gates: and thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God in all that thou puttest thine hand unto.
Deuteronomy 12:19	Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as thou livest upon thy land.
Deuteronomy 12:20	When the LORD thy God shall enlarge thy border, as he hath promised thee, and thou shalt say, I will eat flesh, because thy soul desireth to eat flesh; thou mayest eat flesh, after all the desire of thy soul.
Deuteronomy 12:21	If the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to put his name there be too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock, which the LORD hath given thee, as I have commanded thee, and thou shalt eat within thy gates, after all the desire of thy soul.
Deuteronomy 12:22	Even as the gazelle and as the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat thereof: the unclean and the clean shall eat thereof alike.
Deuteronomy 12:23	Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood is the life; and thou shalt not eat the life with the flesh.
Deuteronomy 12:24	Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it out upon the earth as water.

Deuteronomy 12:29	When the LORD thy God shall cut off the nations from before thee, whither thou goest in to possess them, and thou possessest them, and dwellest in their land;
Deuteronomy 12:30	take heed to thyself that thou be not ensnared to follow them, after that they be destroyed from before thee; and that thou inquire not after their gods, saying, How do these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.
Deuteronomy 12:31	Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God: for every abomination to the LORD, which he hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their sons and their daughters do they burn in the fire to their gods.
Deuteronomy 12:32	What thing soever I command you, that shall ye observe to do: thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it.
Deuteronomy 13:1	If there arise in the midst of thee a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and he give thee a sign or a wonder,
Deuteronomy 13:2	and the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them;
Deuteronomy 13:3	thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or unto that dreamer of dreams: for the LORD your God proveth you, to know whether ye love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul.
Deuteronomy 13:4	Ye shall walk after the LORD your God, and fear him, and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him, and cleave unto him.
Deuteronomy 13:5	And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death; because he hath spoken rebellion against the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of bondage, to draw thee aside out of the way which the LORD thy God commanded thee to walk in. So shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee.
Deuteronomy 13:6	If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers;
Deuteronomy 13:7	of the gods of the peoples which are round about you, nigh unto thee, or far off from thee, from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth;
Deuteronomy 13:8	thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him:
Deuteronomy 13:9	but thou shalt surely kill him; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people.
Deuteronomy 13:10	And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because he hath sought to draw thee away from the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

Deuteronomy 13:13	Certain base fellows are gone out from the midst of thee, and have drawn away the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which ye have not known;
Deuteronomy 13:14	then shalt thou inquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and, behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought in the midst of thee;

Deuteronomy 13:16	And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the street thereof, and shalt burn with fire the city, and all the spoil thereof every whit, unto the LORD thy God: and it shall be an heap for ever; it shall not be built again.
Deuteronomy 13:17	And there shall cleave nought of the devoted thing to thine hand: that the LORD may turn from the fierceness of his anger, and shew thee mercy, and have compassion upon thee, and multiply thee, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers;
Deuteronomy 13:18	when thou shalt hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep all his commandments which I command thee this day, to do that which is right in the eyes of the LORD thy God.
Deuteronomy 14:1	Ye are the children of the LORD your God: ye shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.

Deuteronomy 14:8	and the swine, because he parteth the hoof but cheweth not the cud, he is unclean unto you: of their flesh ye shall not eat, and their carcases ye shall not touch.
Deuteronomy 14:9	These ye shall eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales shall ye eat:

Deuteronomy 14:26	and thou shalt bestow the money for whatsoever thy soul desireth, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatsoever thy soul asketh of thee: and thou shalt eat there before the LORD thy God, and thou shalt rejoice, thou and thine household:

Deuteronomy 14:28	At the end of every three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine increase in the same year, and shalt lay it up within thy gates:

Deuteronomy 15:1	At the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release.

Deuteronomy 18:20	But the prophet, which shall speak a word presumptuously in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die.
Deuteronomy 18:21	And if thou say in thine heart, How shall we know the word which the LORD hath not spoken?
Deuteronomy 18:22	when a prophet speaketh in the name of the LORD, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the LORD hath not spoken: the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously, thou shalt not be afraid of him.

Deuteronomy 19:3	Thou shalt prepare thee the way, and divide the borders of thy land, which the LORD thy God causeth thee to inherit, into three parts, that every manslayer may flee thither.
Deuteronomy 19:4	And this is the case of the manslayer, which shall flee thither and live: whoso killeth his neighbour unawares, and hated him not in time past;
Deuteronomy 19:5	as when a man goeth into the forest with his neighbour to hew wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, and lighteth upon his neighbour, that he die; he shall flee unto one of these cities and live:
Deuteronomy 19:6	lest the avenger of blood pursue the manslayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and smite him mortally; whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past.
Deuteronomy 19:7	Wherefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt separate three cities for thee.
Deuteronomy 19:8	And if the LORD thy God enlarge thy border, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, and give thee all the land which he promised to give unto thy fathers;
Deuteronomy 19:9	if thou shalt keep all this commandment to do it, which I command thee this day, to love the LORD thy God, and to walk ever in his ways; then shalt thou add three cities more for thee, beside these three:
Deuteronomy 19:10	that innocent blood be not shed in the midst of thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and so blood be upon thee.
Deuteronomy 19:11	But if any man hate his neighbour, and lie in wait for him, and rise up against him, and smite him mortally that he die; and he flee into one of these cities:
Deuteronomy 19:12	then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die.

Deuteronomy 29:9	Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that ye may prosper in all that ye do.
Deuteronomy 29:10	Ye stand this day all of you before the LORD your God; your heads, your tribes, your elders, and your officers, even all the men of Israel,
Deuteronomy 29:11	your little ones, your wives, and thy stranger that is in the midst of thy camps, from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water:
Deuteronomy 29:12	that thou shouldest enter into the covenant of the LORD thy God, and into his oath, which the LORD thy God maketh with thee this day:
Deuteronomy 29:13	that he may establish thee this day unto himself for a people, and that he may be unto thee a God, as he spake unto thee, and as he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
Deuteronomy 29:14	Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath;
Deuteronomy 29:15	but with him that standeth here with us this day before the LORD our God, and also with him that is not here with us this day:
Deuteronomy 29:16	(for ye know how we dwelt in the land of Egypt; and how we came through the midst of the nations through which ye passed;
Deuteronomy 29:17	and ye have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which were among them:)
Deuteronomy 29:18	lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from the LORD our God, to go to serve the gods of those nations; lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood;
Deuteronomy 29:19	and it come to pass, when he heareth the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the stubbornness of mine heart, to destroy the moist with the dry:
Deuteronomy 29:20	the LORD will not pardon him, but then the anger of the LORD and his jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the curse that is written in this book shall lie upon him, and the LORD shall blot out his name from under heaven.
Deuteronomy 29:21	And the LORD shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that is written in this book of the law.
Deuteronomy 29:22	And the generation to come, your children that shall rise up after you, and the foreigner that shall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses wherewith the LORD hath made it sick;
Deuteronomy 29:23	and that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and a burning, that it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass groweth therein, like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which the LORD overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath:
Deuteronomy 29:24	even all the nations shall say, Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this land? what meaneth the heat of this great anger?
Deuteronomy 29:25	Then men shall say, Because they forsook the covenant of the LORD, the God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt;
Deuteronomy 29:26	and went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods whom they knew not, and whom he had not given unto them:
Deuteronomy 29:27	therefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curse that is written in this book:
Deuteronomy 29:28	and the LORD rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as at this day.
Deuteronomy 29:29	The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but the things that are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.
Deuteronomy 30:1	And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before thee, and thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations, whither the LORD thy God hath driven thee,
Deuteronomy 30:2	and shalt return unto the LORD thy God, and shalt obey his voice according to all that I command thee this day, thou and thy children, with all thine heart, and with all thy soul;
Deuteronomy 30:3	that then the LORD thy God will turn thy captivity, and have compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all the peoples, whither the LORD thy God hath scattered thee.
Deuteronomy 30:4	If any of thine outcasts be in the uttermost parts of heaven, from thence will the LORD thy God gather thee, and from thence will he fetch thee:
Deuteronomy 30:5	and the LORD thy God will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and he will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers.
Deuteronomy 30:6	And the LORD thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live.

Deuteronomy 30:8	And thou shalt return and obey the voice of the LORD, and do all his commandments which I command thee this day.
Deuteronomy 30:9	And the LORD thy God will make thee plenteous in all the work of thine hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy ground, for good: for the LORD will again rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy fathers:
Deuteronomy 30:10	if thou shalt obey the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law; if thou turn unto the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul.
Deuteronomy 30:11	For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not too hard for thee, neither is it far off.
Deuteronomy 30:12	It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it?
Deuteronomy 30:13	Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it?
Deuteronomy 30:14	But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it.
Deuteronomy 30:15	See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil;
Deuteronomy 30:16	in that I command thee this day to love the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments, that thou mayest live and multiply, and that the LORD thy God may bless thee in the land whither thou goest in to possess it.
Deuteronomy 30:17	But if thine heart turn away, and thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;
Deuteronomy 30:18	I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish; ye shall not prolong your days upon the land, whither thou passest over Jordan to go in to possess it.
Deuteronomy 30:19	I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that I have set before thee life and death, the blessing and the curse: therefore choose life, that thou mayest live, thou and thy seed:
Deuteronomy 30:20	to love the LORD thy God, to obey his voice, and to cleave unto him: for he is thy life, and the length of thy days: that thou mayest dwell in the land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.
Deuteronomy 31:1	And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel.

Deuteronomy 31:5	And the LORD shall deliver them up before you, and ye shall do unto them according unto all the commandment which I have commanded you.
Deuteronomy 31:6	Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be affrighted at them: for the LORD thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.
Deuteronomy 31:7	And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of all Israel, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou shalt go with this people into the land which the LORD hath sworn unto their fathers to give them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it.
Deuteronomy 31:8	And the LORD, he it is that doth go before thee; he will be with thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not, neither be dismayed.
Deuteronomy 31:9	And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and unto all the elders of Israel.
Deuteronomy 31:10	And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven years, in the set time of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,
Deuteronomy 31:11	when all Israel is come to appear before the LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing.
Deuteronomy 31:12	Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones, and thy stranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the LORD your God, and observe to do all the words of this law;
Deuteronomy 31:13	and that their children, which have not known, may hear, and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.
Deuteronomy 31:14	And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that thou must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tent of meeting, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the tent of meeting.
Deuteronomy 31:15	And the LORD appeared in the Tent in a pillar of cloud: and the pillar of cloud stood over the door of the Tent.
Deuteronomy 31:16	And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring after the strange gods of the land, whither they go to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.
Deuteronomy 31:17	Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall come upon them; so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us because our God is not among us?
Deuteronomy 31:18	And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evil which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto other gods.
Deuteronomy 31:19	Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach thou it the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.
Deuteronomy 31:20	For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware unto their fathers, flowing with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and despise me, and break my covenant.
Deuteronomy 31:21	And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are come upon them, that this song shall testify before them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they go about, even now, before I have brought them into the land which I sware.
Deuteronomy 31:22	So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel.
Deuteronomy 31:23	And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I sware unto them: and I will be with thee.
Deuteronomy 31:24	And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,
Deuteronomy 31:25	that Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, saying,
Deuteronomy 31:26	Take this book of the law, and put it by the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee.
Deuteronomy 31:27	For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the LORD; and how much more after my death?
Deuteronomy 31:28	Assemble unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to witness against them.
Deuteronomy 31:29	For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye will do that which is evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands.
Deuteronomy 31:30	And Moses spake in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song, until they were finished.
Deuteronomy 32:1	Give ear, ye heavens, and I will speak; And let the earth hear the words of my mouth:
Deuteronomy 32:2	My doctrine shall drop as the rain, My speech shall distil as the dew; As the small rain upon the tender grass, And as the showers upon the herb:
Deuteronomy 32:3	For I will proclaim the name of the LORD: Ascribe ye greatness unto our God.
Deuteronomy 32:4	The Rock, his work is perfect; For all his ways are judgment: A God of faithfulness and without iniquity, Just and right is he.

Deuteronomy 32:8	When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance, When he separated the children of men, He set the bounds of the peoples According to the number of the children of Israel.
Deuteronomy 32:9	For the LORD’S portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.
Deuteronomy 32:10	He found him in a desert land, And in the waste howling wilderness; He compassed him about, he cared for him, He kept him as the apple of his eye:
Deuteronomy 32:11	As an eagle that stirreth up her nest, That fluttereth over her young, He spread abroad his wings, he took them, He bare them on his pinions:
Deuteronomy 32:12	The LORD alone did lead him, And there was no strange god with him.
Deuteronomy 32:13	He made him ride on the high places of the earth, And he did eat the increase of the field; And he made him to suck honey out of the rock, And oil out of the flinty rock;
Deuteronomy 32:14	Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, With fat of lambs, And rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, With the fat of kidneys of wheat; And of the blood of the grape thou drankest wine.
Deuteronomy 32:15	But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: Thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art become sleek: Then he forsook God which made him, And lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.
Deuteronomy 32:16	They moved him to jealousy with strange gods, With abominations provoked they him to anger.
Deuteronomy 32:17	They sacrificed unto demons, which were no God, To gods whom they knew not, To new gods that came up of late, Whom your fathers dreaded not.

Deuteronomy 32:19	And the LORD saw it, and abhorred them, Because of the provocation of his sons and his daughters.

Deuteronomy 32:22	For a fire is kindled in mine anger, And burneth unto the lowest pit, And devoureth the earth with her increase, And setteth on fire the foundations of the mountains.
Deuteronomy 32:23	I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them:
Deuteronomy 32:24	They shall be wasted with hunger, and devoured with burning heat And bitter destruction; And the teeth of beasts will I send upon them, With the poison of crawling things of the dust.
Deuteronomy 32:25	Without shall the sword bereave, And in the chambers terror; It shall destroy both young man and virgin, The suckling with the man of gray hairs.
Deuteronomy 32:26	I said, I would scatter them afar, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men:
Deuteronomy 32:27	Were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy, Lest their adversaries should misdeem, Lest they should say, Our hand is exalted, And the LORD hath not done all this.
Deuteronomy 32:28	For they are a nation void of counsel, And there is no understanding in them.
Deuteronomy 32:29	Oh that they were wise, that they understood this, That they would consider their latter end!
Deuteronomy 32:30	How should one chase a thousand, And two put ten thousand to flight, Except their Rock had sold them, And the LORD had delivered them up?
Deuteronomy 32:31	For their rock is not as our Rock, Even our enemies themselves being judges.
Deuteronomy 32:32	For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, And of the fields of Gomorrah: Their grapes are grapes of gall, Their clusters are bitter:
Deuteronomy 32:33	Their wine is the poison of dragons, And the cruel venom of asps.
Deuteronomy 32:34	Is not this laid up in store with me, Sealed up among my treasures?
Deuteronomy 32:35	Vengeance is mine, and recompence, At the time when their foot shall slide: For the day of their calamity is at hand, And the things that are to come upon them shall make haste.

Deuteronomy 32:37	And he shall say, Where are their gods, The rock in which they trusted;
Deuteronomy 32:38	Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, And drank the wine of their drink offering? Let them rise up and help you, Let them be your protection.
Deuteronomy 32:39	See now that I, even I, am he, And there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I have wounded, and I heal: And there is none that can deliver out of my hand.
Deuteronomy 32:40	For I lift up my hand to heaven, And say, As I live for ever,
Deuteronomy 32:41	If I whet my glittering sword, And mine hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to mine adversaries, And will recompense them that hate me.
Deuteronomy 32:42	I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, And my sword shall devour flesh; With the blood of the slain and the captives, From the head of the leaders of the enemy.

Deuteronomy 32:44	And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.
Deuteronomy 32:45	And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel:

Deuteronomy 32:47	For it is no vain thing for you; because it is your life, and through this thing ye shall prolong your days upon the land, whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.
Deuteronomy 32:48	And the LORD spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying,
Deuteronomy 32:49	Get thee up into this mountain of Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession:
Deuteronomy 32:50	and die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people:
Deuteronomy 32:51	because ye trespassed against me in the midst of the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel.
Deuteronomy 32:52	For thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go thither into the land which I give the children of Israel.
Deuteronomy 33:1	And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.
Deuteronomy 33:2	And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, And rose from Seir unto them; He shined forth from mount Paran, And he came from the ten thousands of holy ones: At his right hand was a fiery law unto them.

Deuteronomy 33:10	They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, And Israel thy law: They shall put incense before thee, And whole burnt offering upon thine altar.

Deuteronomy 33:15	And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, And for the precious things of the everlasting hills,

Deuteronomy 34:1	And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. And the LORD shewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan;

Deuteronomy 34:11	in all the signs and the wonders, which the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land;
Deuteronomy 34:12	and in all the mighty hand, and in all the great terror, which Moses wrought in the sight of all Israel.
Joshua 1:1	Now it came to pass after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD, that the LORD spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses’ minister, saying,
Joshua 1:2	Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel.
Joshua 1:3	Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, to you have I given it, as I spake unto Moses.
Joshua 1:4	From the wilderness, and this Lebanon, even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your border.
Joshua 1:5	There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee: I will not fail thee nor forsake thee.
Joshua 1:6	Be strong and of a good courage: for thou shalt cause this people to inherit the land which I sware unto their fathers to give them.
Joshua 1:7	Only be strong and very courageous, to observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest have good success whithersoever thou goest.
Joshua 1:8	This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.
Joshua 1:9	Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not affrighted, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.
Joshua 1:10	Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,
Joshua 1:11	Pass through the midst of the camp, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye are to pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the LORD your God giveth you to possess it.
Joshua 1:12	And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying,
Joshua 1:13	Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, The LORD your God giveth you rest, and will give you this land.
Joshua 1:14	Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall abide in the land which Moses gave you beyond Jordan; but ye shall pass over before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour, and shall help them;
Joshua 1:15	until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as he hath given you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, and possess it, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you beyond Jordan toward the sunrising.
Joshua 1:16	And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou hast commanded us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us we will go.
Joshua 1:17	According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee: only the LORD thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses.
Joshua 1:18	Whosoever he be that shall rebel against thy commandment, and shall not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good courage.
Joshua 2:1	And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men as spies secretly, saying, Go view the land, and Jericho. And they went, and came into the house of an harlot whose name was Rahab, and lay there.
Joshua 2:2	And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither to-night of the children of Israel to search out the land.
Joshua 2:3	And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are come to thee, which are entered into thine house: for they be come to search out all the land.
Joshua 2:4	And the woman took the two men, and hid them; and she said, Yea, the men came unto me, but I wist not whence they were:
Joshua 2:5	and it came to pass about the time of the shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out: whither the men went I wot not: pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them.
Joshua 2:6	But she had brought them up to the roof, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.
Joshua 2:7	And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords: and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate.
Joshua 2:8	And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof;
Joshua 2:9	and she said unto the men, I know that the LORD hath given you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you.
Joshua 2:10	For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red Sea before you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond Jordan, unto Sihon and to Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.
Joshua 2:11	And as soon as we had heard it, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more spirit in any man, because of you: for the LORD your God, he is God in heaven above, and on earth beneath.
Joshua 2:12	Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD, since I have dealt kindly with you, that ye also will deal kindly with my father’s house, and give me a true token:
Joshua 2:13	and that ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and will deliver our lives from death.
Joshua 2:14	And the men said unto her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not this our business; and it shall be, when the LORD giveth us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.
Joshua 2:15	Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house was upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.
Joshua 2:16	And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers light upon you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way.
Joshua 2:17	And the men said unto her, We will be guiltless of this thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.
Joshua 2:18	Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: and thou shalt gather unto thee into the house thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father’s household.
Joshua 2:19	And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we will be guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him.
Joshua 2:20	But if thou utter this our business, then we will be guiltless of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.
Joshua 2:21	And she said, According unto your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window.
Joshua 2:22	And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found them not.
Joshua 2:23	Then the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun; and they told him all that had befallen them.
Joshua 2:24	And they said unto Joshua, Truly the LORD hath delivered into our hands all the land; and moreover all the inhabitants of the land do melt away before us.
Joshua 3:1	And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and they removed from Shittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel; and they lodged there before they passed over.
Joshua 3:2	And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the midst of the camp;
Joshua 3:3	and they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after it.
Joshua 3:4	Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go; for ye have not passed this way heretofore.
Joshua 3:5	And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for tomorrow the LORD will do wonders among you.
Joshua 3:6	And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.
Joshua 3:7	And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee.
Joshua 3:8	And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the waters of Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan.
Joshua 3:9	And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear the words of the LORD your God.
Joshua 3:10	And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Hivite, and the Perizzite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Jebusite.
Joshua 3:11	Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth over before you into Jordan.
Joshua 3:12	Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, for every tribe a man.
Joshua 3:13	And it shall come to pass, when the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off, even the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand in one heap.
Joshua 3:14	And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to pass over Jordan, the priests that bare the ark of the covenant being before the people;
Joshua 3:15	and when they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brink of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all its banks all the time of harvest,)
Joshua 3:16	that the waters which came down from above stood, and rose up in one heap, a great way off, at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan: and those that went down toward the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, were wholly cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho.
Joshua 3:17	And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all Israel passed over on dry ground, until all the nation were passed clean over Jordan.
Joshua 4:1	And it came to pass, when all the nation were clean passed over Jordan, that the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying,
Joshua 4:2	Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,
Joshua 4:3	and command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan, out of the place where the priests’ feet stood firm, twelve stones, and carry them over with you, and lay them down in the lodging place, where ye shall lodge this night.
Joshua 4:4	Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man:
Joshua 4:5	and Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of Jordan, and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel:
Joshua 4:6	that this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these stones?
Joshua 4:7	then ye shall say unto them, Because the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it passed over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever.
Joshua 4:8	And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, as the LORD spake unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel; and they carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.
Joshua 4:9	And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there, unto this day.
Joshua 4:10	For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of Jordan, until every thing was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua: and the people hasted and passed over.
Joshua 4:11	And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, that the ark of the LORD passed over, and the priests, in the presence of the people.
Joshua 4:12	And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spake unto them:
Joshua 4:13	about forty thousand ready armed for war passed over before the LORD unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.
Joshua 4:14	On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.
Joshua 4:15	And the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying,
Joshua 4:16	Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of Jordan.
Joshua 4:17	Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of Jordan.
Joshua 4:18	And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD were come up out of the midst of Jordan, and the soles of the priests’ feet were lifted up unto the dry ground, that the waters of Jordan returned unto their place, and went over all its banks, as aforetime.
Joshua 4:19	And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, on the east border of Jericho.
Joshua 4:20	And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did Joshua set up in Gilgal.
Joshua 4:21	And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these stones?
Joshua 4:22	Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.
Joshua 4:23	For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you, until ye were passed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red Sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were passed over:
Joshua 4:24	that all the peoples of the earth may know the hand of the LORD, that it is mighty; that they may fear the LORD your God for ever.
Joshua 5:1	And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which were beyond Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, which were by the sea, heard how that the LORD had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.
Joshua 5:2	At that time the LORD said unto Joshua, Make thee knives of flint, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.
Joshua 5:3	And Joshua made him knives of flint, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.
Joshua 5:4	And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: all the people that came forth out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came forth out of Egypt.
Joshua 5:5	For all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, they had not circumcised.
Joshua 5:6	For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the nation, even the men of war which came forth out of Egypt, were consumed, because they hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD: unto whom the LORD sware that he would not let them see the land which the LORD sware unto their fathers that he would give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.
Joshua 5:7	And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them did Joshua circumcise: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way.
Joshua 5:8	And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the nation, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole.
Joshua 5:9	And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of that place was called Gilgal, unto this day.
Joshua 5:10	And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal; and they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho.
Joshua 5:11	And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes and parched corn, in the selfsame day.
Joshua 5:12	And the manna ceased on the morrow, after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.
Joshua 5:13	And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?
Joshua 5:14	And he said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto him, What saith my lord unto his servant?
Joshua 5:15	And the captain of the LORD’S host said unto Joshua, Put off thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy. And Joshua did so.
Joshua 6:1	(NOW Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in.)
Joshua 6:2	And the LORD said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thine hand Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of valour.
Joshua 6:3	And ye shall compass the city, all the men of war, going about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days.
Joshua 6:4	And seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.
Joshua 6:5	And it shall be, that when they make a long blast with the ram’s horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall go up every man straight before him.
Joshua 6:6	And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the LORD.
Joshua 6:7	And they said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let the armed men pass on before the ark of the LORD.
Joshua 6:8	And it was so, that when Joshua had spoken unto the people, the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the LORD passed on, and blew with the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them.
Joshua 6:9	And the armed men went before the priests that blew the trumpets, and the rearward went after the ark, the priests blowing with the trumpets as they went.
Joshua 6:10	And Joshua commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor let your voice be heard, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye shout.
Joshua 6:11	So he caused the ark of the LORD to compass the city, going about it once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.
Joshua 6:12	And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD.
Joshua 6:13	And the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets; and the armed men went before them; and the rearward came after the ark of the LORD, the priests blowing with the trumpets as they went.
Joshua 6:14	And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp: so they did six days.
Joshua 6:15	And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early at the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven times.
Joshua 6:16	And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the LORD hath given you the city.
Joshua 6:17	And the city shall be devoted, even it and all that is therein, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.
Joshua 6:18	And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the devoted thing, lest when ye have devoted it, ye take of the devoted thing; so should ye make the camp of Israel accursed, and trouble it.
Joshua 6:19	But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are holy unto the LORD: they shall come into the treasury of the LORD.
Joshua 6:20	So the people shouted, and the priests blew with the trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, that the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.
Joshua 6:21	And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, both young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.
Joshua 6:22	And Joshua said unto the two men that had spied out the land, Go into the harlot’s house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her.
Joshua 6:23	And the young men the spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had, all her kindred also they brought out; and they set them without the camp of Israel.
Joshua 6:24	And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD.
Joshua 6:25	But Rahab the harlot, and her father’s household, and all that she had, did Joshua save alive; and she dwelt in the midst of Israel, unto this day; because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.
Joshua 6:26	And Joshua charged them with an oath at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: with the loss of his firstborn shall he lay the foundation thereof, and with the loss of his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.
Joshua 6:27	So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was in all the land.
Joshua 7:1	But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the devoted thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the devoted thing: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel.
Joshua 7:2	And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth-aven, on the east side of Beth-el, and spake unto them, saying, Go up and spy out the land. And the men went up and spied out Ai.
Joshua 7:3	And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; make not all the people to toil thither; for they are but few.
Joshua 7:4	So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai.
Joshua 7:5	And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: and they chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim, and smote them at the going down: and the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.
Joshua 7:6	And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the LORD until the evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust upon their heads.
Joshua 7:7	And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord GOD, wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to cause us to perish? would that we had been content and dwelt beyond Jordan!
Joshua 7:8	Oh Lord, what shall I say, after that Israel hath turned their backs before their enemies!
Joshua 7:9	For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it, and shall compass us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do for thy great name?
Joshua 7:10	And the LORD said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore art thou thus fallen upon thy face?
Joshua 7:11	Israel hath sinned; yea, they have even transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: yea, they have even taken of the devoted thing; and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have even put it among their own stuff.
Joshua 7:12	Therefore the children of Israel cannot stand before their enemies, they turn their backs before their enemies, because they are become accursed: I will not be with you any more, except ye destroy the devoted thing from among you.
Joshua 7:13	Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow: for thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, There is a devoted thing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the devoted thing from among you.
Joshua 7:14	In the morning therefore ye shall be brought near by your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the LORD taketh shall come near by families; and the family which the LORD shall take shall come near by households; and the household which the LORD shall take shall come near man by man.
Joshua 7:15	And it shall be, that he that is taken with the devoted thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath: because he hath transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he hath wrought folly in Israel.
Joshua 7:16	So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel near by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:
Joshua 7:17	and he brought near the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zerahites: and he brought near the family of the Zerahites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:
Joshua 7:18	and he brought near his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.
Joshua 7:19	And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the LORD, the God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me now what thou hast done; hide it not from me.
Joshua 7:20	And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Of a truth I have sinned against the LORD, the God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:
Joshua 7:21	when I saw among the spoil a goodly Babylonish mantle, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, beheld, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.
Joshua 7:22	So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.
Joshua 7:23	And they took them from the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel; and they laid them down before the LORD.
Joshua 7:24	And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the mantle, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them up unto the valley of Achor.
Joshua 7:25	And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones; and they burned them with fire, and stoned them with stones.
Joshua 7:26	And they raised over him a great heap of stones, unto this day; and the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, unto this day.
Joshua 8:1	And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city and his land:
Joshua 8:2	And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: set thee an ambush for the city behind it.
Joshua 8:3	So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up to Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand men, the mighty men of valour, and sent them forth by night.
Joshua 8:4	And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in ambush against the city, behind the city: go not very far from the city, but be ye all ready:
Joshua 8:5	and I, and all the people that are with me, will approach unto the city: and it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them;
Joshua 8:6	and they will come out after us, till we have drawn them away from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first; so we will flee before them:
Joshua 8:7	and ye shall rise up from the ambush, and take possession of the city: for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand.
Joshua 8:8	And it shall be, when ye have seized upon the city, that ye shall set the city on fire; according to the word of the LORD shall ye do: see, I have commanded you.
Joshua 8:9	And Joshua sent them forth: and they went to the ambushment, and abode between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people.
Joshua 8:10	And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and mustered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.
Joshua 8:11	And all the people, even the men of war that were with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between him and Ai.
Joshua 8:12	And he took about five thousand men, and set them in ambush between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of the city.
Joshua 8:13	So they set the people, even all the host that was on the north of the city, and their liers in wait that were on the west of the city; and Joshua went that night into the midst of the vale.
Joshua 8:14	And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at the time appointed, before the Arabah; but he wist not that there was an ambush against him behind the city.
Joshua 8:15	And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.
Joshua 8:16	And all the people that were in the city were called together to pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.
Joshua 8:17	And there was not a man left in Ai or Beth-el, that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.
Joshua 8:18	And the LORD said unto Joshua, Stretch out the javelin that is in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thine hand. And Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city.
Joshua 8:19	And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand, and entered into the city, and took it; and they hasted and set the city on fire.
Joshua 8:20	And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.
Joshua 8:21	And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai.
Joshua 8:22	And the other came forth out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.
Joshua 8:23	And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.
Joshua 8:24	And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they pursued them, and they were all fallen by the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all Israel returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.
Joshua 8:25	And all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.
Joshua 8:26	For Joshua drew not back his hand wherewith he stretched out the javelin, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.
Joshua 8:27	Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey unto themselves, according unto the word of the LORD which he commanded Joshua.
Joshua 8:28	So Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a desolation, unto this day.
Joshua 8:29	And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until the eventide: and at the going down of the sun Joshua commanded, and they took his carcase down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city, and raised thereon a great heap of stones, unto this day.
Joshua 8:30	Then Joshua built an altar unto the LORD, the God of Israel, in mount Ebal,
Joshua 8:31	as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of unhewn stones, upon which no man had lift up any iron: and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the LORD, and sacrificed peace offerings.
Joshua 8:32	And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote, in the presence of the children of Israel.
Joshua 8:33	And all Israel, and their elders and officers, and their judges, stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, as well the stranger as the homeborn; half of them in front of mount Gerizim, and half of them in front of mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded, that they should bless the people of Israel first of all.
Joshua 8:34	And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the book of the law.
Joshua 8:35	There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the assembly of Israel, and the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them.
Joshua 9:1	And it came to pass when all the kings which were beyond Jordan, in the hill country, and in the lowland, and on all the shore of the great sea in front of Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard thereof;
Joshua 9:2	that they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord.
Joshua 9:3	But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto Jericho and to Ai,
Joshua 9:4	they also did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wineskins, old and rent and bound up;
Joshua 9:5	and old shoes and clouted upon their feet, and old garments upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry and was become mouldy.
Joshua 9:6	And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto him, and to the men of Israel, We are come from a far country: now therefore make ye a covenant with us.
Joshua 9:7	And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell among us; and how shall we make a covenant with you?
Joshua 9:8	And they said unto Joshua, We are thy servants. And Joshua said unto them, Who are ye? and from whence come ye?
Joshua 9:9	And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the LORD thy God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,
Joshua 9:10	and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, which was at Ashtaroth.
Joshua 9:11	And our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us saying, Take provision in your hand for the journey and go to meet them, and say unto them, We are your servants: and now make ye a covenant with us.
Joshua 9:12	This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and is become mouldy:
Joshua 9:13	and these wineskins, which we filled, were new; and, behold, they be rent: and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey.
Joshua 9:14	And the men took of their provision, and asked not counsel at the mouth of the LORD.
Joshua 9:15	And Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them, to let them live: and the princes of the congregation sware unto them.
Joshua 9:16	And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, that they heard that they were their neighbours, and that they dwelt among them.
Joshua 9:17	And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim.
Joshua 9:18	And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD, the God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes.
Joshua 9:19	But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn unto them by the LORD, the God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them.
Joshua 9:20	This we will do to them, and let them live; lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto them.
Joshua 9:21	And the princes said unto them, Let them live: so they became hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation; as the princes had spoken unto them.
Joshua 9:22	And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying, Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you; when ye dwell among us?
Joshua 9:23	Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall never fail to be of you bondmen, both hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.
Joshua 9:24	And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how that the LORD thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you; therefore we were sore afraid for our lives because of you, and have done this thing.
Joshua 9:25	And now, behold, we are in thine hand: as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us, do.
Joshua 9:26	And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not.
Joshua 9:27	And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD, unto this day, in the place which he should choose.
Joshua 10:1	Now it came to pass, when Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;
Joshua 10:2	that they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the men thereof were mighty.
Joshua 10:3	Wherefore Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,
Joshua 10:4	Come up unto me, and help me, and let us smite Gibeon: for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.
Joshua 10:5	Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped against Gibeon, and made war against it.
Joshua 10:6	And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the hill country are gathered together against us.
Joshua 10:7	So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valour.
Joshua 10:8	And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have delivered them into thine hands; there shall not a man of them stand before thee.
Joshua 10:9	Joshua therefore came upon them suddenly; for he went up from Gilgal all the night.
Joshua 10:10	And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and he slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them by the way of the ascent of Beth-horon, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah.
Joshua 10:11	And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, while they were in the going down of Beth-horon, that the LORD cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were more which died with the hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.
Joshua 10:12	Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel; and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Aijalon.
Joshua 10:13	And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the nation had avenged themselves of their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jashar? And the sun stayed in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.
Joshua 10:14	And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the LORD hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the LORD fought for Israel.
Joshua 10:15	And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.
Joshua 10:16	And these five kings fled, and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah.
Joshua 10:17	And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found, hidden in the cave at Makkedah.
Joshua 10:18	And Joshua said, Roll great stones unto the mouth of the cave, and set men by it for to keep them:
Joshua 10:19	but stay not ye; pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for the LORD your God hath delivered them into your hand.
Joshua 10:20	And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, and the remnant which remained of them had entered into the fenced cities,
Joshua 10:21	that all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.
Joshua 10:22	Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring forth those five kings unto me out of the cave.
Joshua 10:23	And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon.
Joshua 10:24	And it came to pass, when they brought forth those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the chiefs of the men of war which went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.
Joshua 10:25	And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed; be strong and of good courage: for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies against whom ye fight.
Joshua 10:26	And afterward Joshua smote them, and put them to death, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.
Joshua 10:27	And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had hidden themselves, and laid great stones on the mouth of the cave, unto this very day.
Joshua 10:28	And Joshua took Makkedah on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof; he utterly destroyed them and all the souls that were therein, he left none remaining: and he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done unto the king of Jericho.
Joshua 10:29	And Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah:
Joshua 10:30	and the LORD delivered it also, and the king thereof, into the hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining in it; and he did unto the king thereof as he had done unto the king of Jericho.
Joshua 10:31	And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it:
Joshua 10:32	and the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, and he took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein, according to all that he had done to Libnah.
Joshua 10:33	Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.
Joshua 10:34	And Joshua passed from Lachish, and all Israel with him, unto Eglon; and they encamped against it, and fought against it;
Joshua 10:35	and they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.
Joshua 10:36	And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron; and they fought against it:
Joshua 10:37	and they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but he utterly destroyed it, and all the souls that were therein.
Joshua 10:38	And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and fought against it:
Joshua 10:39	and he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to the king thereof.
Joshua 10:40	So Joshua smote all the land, the hill country, and the South, and the lowland, and the slopes, and all their kings; he left none remaining: but he utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD, the God of Israel, commanded.
Joshua 10:41	And Joshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea even unto Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.
Joshua 10:42	And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because the LORD, the God of Israel, fought for Israel.
Joshua 10:43	And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.
Joshua 11:1	And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor heard thereof, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,
Joshua 11:2	and to the kings that were on the north, in the hill country, and in the Arabah south of Chinneroth, and in the lowland, and in the heights of Dor on the west,
Joshua 11:3	to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the hill country, and the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpah.
Joshua 11:4	And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many.
Joshua 11:5	And all these kings met together; and they came and pitched together at the waters of Merom, to fight with Israel.
Joshua 11:6	And the LORD said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them: for tomorrow at this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel: thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their chariots with fire.
Joshua 11:7	So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly, and fell upon them.
Joshua 11:8	And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, and they smote them, and chased them unto great Zidon, and unto Misrephoth-maim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left them none remaining.
Joshua 11:9	And Joshua did unto them as the LORD bade him: he houghed their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.
Joshua 11:10	And Jeshua turned back at that time, and took Hazor, and smote the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms.
Joshua 11:11	And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them: there was none left that breathed: and he burnt Hazor with fire.
Joshua 11:12	And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did Joshua take, and he smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed them; as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded.
Joshua 11:13	But as for the cities that stood on their mounds, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn.
Joshua 11:14	And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any that breathed.
Joshua 11:15	As the LORD commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua: and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that the LORD commanded Moses.
Joshua 11:16	So Joshua took all that land, the hill country, and all the South, and all the land of Goshen, and the lowland, and the Arabah, and the hill country of Israel, and the lowland of the same;
Joshua 11:17	from mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and smote them, and put them to death.
Joshua 11:18	Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.
Joshua 11:19	There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: they took all in battle.
Joshua 11:20	For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, to come against Israel in battle, that he might utterly destroy them, that they might have no favour, but that he might destroy them, as the LORD commanded Moses.
Joshua 11:21	And Joshua came at that time, and cut off the Anakim from the hill country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill country of Israel: Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities.
Joshua 11:22	There was none of the Anakim left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, did some remain.
Joshua 11:23	So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD spake unto Moses: and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land had rest from war.
Joshua 12:1	Now these are the kings of the land, whom the children of Israel smote, and possessed their land beyond Jordan toward the sunrising, from the valley of Arnon unto mount Hermon, and all the Arabah eastward:
Joshua 12:2	Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and half Gilead, even unto the river Jabbok, the border of the children of Ammon;
Joshua 12:3	and the Arabah unto the sea of Chinneroth, eastward, and unto the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, eastward, the way to Beth-jeshimoth; and on the south, under the slopes of Pisgah:
Joshua 12:4	and the border of Og king of Bashan, of the remnant of the Rephaim, who dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,
Joshua 12:5	and ruled in mount Hermon, and in Salecah, and in all Bashan, unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.
Joshua 12:6	Moses the servant of the LORD and the children of Israel smote them: and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it for a possession unto the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh.
Joshua 12:7	And these are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the children of Israel smote beyond Jordan westward, from Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon even unto mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir; and Joshua gave it unto the tribes of Israel for a possession according to their divisions;
Joshua 12:8	in the hill country, and in the lowland, and in the Arabah, and in the slopes, and in the wilderness, and in the South; the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:
Joshua 12:9	the king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Beth-el, one;
Joshua 12:10	the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;
Joshua 12:11	the king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;
Joshua 12:12	the king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;
Joshua 12:13	the king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;
Joshua 12:14	the king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;
Joshua 12:15	the king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;
Joshua 12:16	the king of Makkedah, one; the king of Beth-el, one;
Joshua 12:17	the king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;
Joshua 12:18	the king of Aphek, one; the king of Lassharon, one;
Joshua 12:19	the king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;
Joshua 12:20	the king of Shimron-meron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;
Joshua 12:21	the king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;
Joshua 12:22	the king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one;
Joshua 12:23	the king of Dor in the height of Dor, one; the king of Goiim in Gilgal, one;
Joshua 12:24	the king of Tirzah, one: all the kings thirty and one.
Joshua 13:1	Now Joshua was old and well stricken in years; and the LORD said unto him, Thou art old and well stricken in years, and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed.
Joshua 13:2	This is the land that yet remaineth: all the regions of the Philistines, and all the Geshurites;
Joshua 13:3	from the Shihor, which is before Egypt, even unto the border of Ekron northward, which is counted to the Canaanites: the five lords of the Philistines. the Gazites, and the Ashdodites, the Ashkelonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avvim,
Joshua 13:4	on the south: all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that belongeth to the Zidonians, unto Aphek, to the border of the Amorites:
Joshua 13:5	and the land of the Gebalites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrising, from Baal-gad under mount Hermon unto the entering in of Hamath:
Joshua 13:6	all the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon unto Misrephoth-maim, even all the Zidonians; them will I drive out from before the children of Israel: only allot thou it unto Israel for an inheritance, as I have commanded thee.
Joshua 13:7	Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine tribes, and the half tribe of Manasseh.
Joshua 13:8	With him the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond Jordan eastward, even as Moses the servant of the LORD gave them;
Joshua 13:9	from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley of Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the plain of Medeba unto Dibon;
Joshua 13:10	and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, unto the border of the children of Ammon;
Joshua 13:11	and Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites, and all mount Hermon, and all Bashan unto Salecah;
Joshua 13:12	all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, which reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei (the same was left of the remnant of the Rephaim); for these did Moses smite, and drave them out.
Joshua 13:13	Nevertheless the children of Israel drave not out the Geshurites, nor the Maacathites: but Geshur and Maacath dwelt in the midst of Israel, unto this day.
Joshua 13:14	Only unto the tribe of Levi he gave none inheritance; the offerings of the LORD, the God of Israel, made by fire are his inheritance, as he spake unto him.
Joshua 13:15	And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben according to their families.
Joshua 13:16	And their border was from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley of Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the plain by Medeba;
Joshua 13:17	Heshbon, and all her cities that are in the plain; Dibon, and Bamoth-baal, and Beth-baal-meon;
Joshua 13:18	and Jahaz, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath;
Joshua 13:19	and Kiriathaim, and Sibmah, and Zereth-shahar in the mount of the valley;
Joshua 13:20	and Beth-peor, and the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth-jeshimoth;
Joshua 13:21	and all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses smote with the chiefs of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, the princes of Sihon, that dwelt in the land.
Joshua 13:22	Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children of Israel slay with the sword among the rest of their slain.
Joshua 13:23	And the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan, and the border thereof. This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben according to their families, the cities and the villages thereof.
Joshua 13:24	And Moses gave unto the tribe of Gad, unto the children of Gad, according to their families.
Joshua 13:25	And their border was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, unto Aroer that is before Rabbah;
Joshua 13:26	and from Heshbon unto Ramath-mizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim unto the border of Debir;
Joshua 13:27	and in the valley, Beth-haram, and Beth-nimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, Jordan and the border thereof, unto the uttermost part of the sea of Chinnereth beyond Jordan eastward.
Joshua 13:28	This is the inheritance of the children of Gad according to their families, the cities and the villages thereof.
Joshua 13:29	And Moses gave inheritance unto the half tribe of Manasseh: and it was for the half tribe of the children of Manasseh according to their families.
Joshua 13:30	And their border was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, threescore cities:
Joshua 13:31	and half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, the cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were for the children of Machir the son of Manasseh, even for the half of the children of Machir according to their families.
Joshua 13:32	These are the inheritances which Moses distributed in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan at Jericho, eastward.
Joshua 13:33	But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave none inheritance: the LORD, the God of Israel, is their inheritance, as he spake unto them.
Joshua 14:1	And these are the inheritances which the children of Israel took in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers’ houses of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed unto them,
Joshua 14:2	by the lot of their inheritance, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half tribe.
Joshua 14:3	For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half tribe beyond Jordan: but unto the Levites he gave none inheritance among them.
Joshua 14:4	For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: and they gave no portion unto the Levites in the land, save cities to dwell in, with the suburbs thereof for their cattle and for their substance.
Joshua 14:5	As the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did, and they divided the land.
Joshua 14:6	Then the children of Judah drew nigh unto Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said unto him, Thou knowest the thing that the LORD spake unto Moses the man of God concerning me and concerning thee in Kadesh-barnea.
Joshua 14:7	Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land; and I brought him word again as it was in mine heart.
Joshua 14:8	Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt: but I wholly followed the LORD my God.
Joshua 14:9	And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy foot hath trodden shall be an inheritance to thee and to thy children for ever, because thou hast wholly followed the LORD my God.
Joshua 14:10	And now, behold, the LORD hath kept me alive, as he spake, these forty and five years, from the time that the LORD spake this word unto Moses, while Israel walked in the wilderness: and now, lo, I am this day fourscore and five years old.
Joshua 14:11	As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war and to go out and to come in.
Joshua 14:12	Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the LORD spake in that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakim were there, and cities great and fenced: it may be that the LORD will be with me, and I shall drive them out, as the LORD spake.
Joshua 14:13	And Joshua blessed him; and he gave Hebron unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance.
Joshua 14:14	Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, unto this day; because that he wholly followed the LORD, the God of Israel.
Joshua 14:15	Now the name of Hebron beforetime was Kirjath-arba; which Arba was the greatest man among the Anakim. And the land had rest from war.
Joshua 15:1	And the lot for the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families was unto the border of Edom, even to the wilderness of Zin southward, at the uttermost part of the south.
Joshua 15:2	And their south border was from the uttermost part of the Salt Sea, from the bay that looked southward:
Joshua 15:3	and it went out southward of the ascent of Akrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and went up by the south of Kadesh-barnea, and passed along by Hezron, and went up to Addar, and turned about to Karka:
Joshua 15:4	and it passed along to Azmon, and went out at the brook of Egypt; and the goings out of the border were at the sea: this shall be your south border.
Joshua 15:5	And the east border was the Salt Sea, even unto the end of Jordan. And the border of the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the end of Jordan:
Joshua 15:6	and the border went up to Beth-hoglah, and passed along by the north of Beth-arabah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben:
Joshua 15:7	and the border went up to Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is over against the ascent of Adummim, which is on the south side of the river: and the border passed along to the waters of En-shemesh, and the goings out thereof were at En-rogel:
Joshua 15:8	and the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto the side of the Jebusite southward (the same is Jerusalem): and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lieth before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the uttermost part of the vale of Rephaim northward:
Joshua 15:9	and the border was drawn from the top of the mountain unto the fountain of the waters of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of mount Ephron; and the border was drawn to Baalah (the same is Kiriath-jearim):
Joshua 15:10	and the border turned about from Baalah westward unto mount Seir, and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim on the north (the same is Chesalon), and went down to Beth-shemesh, and passed along by Timnah:
Joshua 15:11	and the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward: and the border was drawn to Shikkeron, and passed along to mount Baalah, and went out at Jabneel; and the goings out of the border were at the sea.
Joshua 15:12	And the west border was to the great sea, and the border thereof. This is the border of the children of Judah round about according to their families.
Joshua 15:13	And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a portion among the children of Judah, according to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua, even Kirjath-arba, which Arba was the father of Anak (the same is Hebron).
Joshua 15:14	And Caleb drove out thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.
Joshua 15:15	And he went up thence against the inhabitants of Debir: now the name of Debir beforetime was Kiriath-sepher.
Joshua 15:16	And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kiriath-sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.
Joshua 15:17	And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.
Joshua 15:18	And it came to pass, when she came unto him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted down from off her ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wouldest thou?
Joshua 15:19	And she said, Give me a blessing; for that thou hast set me in the land of the South, give me also springs of water. And he gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.
Joshua 15:20	This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families.
Joshua 15:21	And the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the border of Edom in the South were Kabzeel and Eder, and Jagur;
Joshua 15:22	and Kinah, and Dimonah, and Adadah;
Joshua 15:23	and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Ithnan;

Joshua 15:47	Ashdod, her towns and her villages; Gaza, her towns and her villages; unto the brook of Egypt, and the great sea, and the border thereof.
Joshua 15:48	And in the hill country, Shamir, and Jattir, and Socoh;

Joshua 15:61	In the wilderness, Beth-arabah, Middin, and Secacah;
Joshua 15:62	and Nibshan, and the City of Salt, and En-gedi; six cities with their villages.
Joshua 15:63	And as for the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of Judah could not drive them out: but the Jebusites dwelt with the children of Judah at Jerusalem, unto this day.
Joshua 16:1	And the lot for the children of Joseph went out from the Jordan at Jericho, at the waters of Jericho on the east, even the wilderness, going up from Jericho through the hill country to Beth-el;
Joshua 16:2	and it went out from Beth-el to Luz, and passed along unto the border of the Archites to Ataroth;
Joshua 16:3	and it went down westward to the border of the Japhletites, unto the border of Beth-horon the nether, even unto Gezer: and the goings out thereof were at the sea.
Joshua 16:4	And the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their inheritance.
Joshua 16:5	And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families was thus: even the border of their inheritance eastward was Ataroth-addar, unto Beth-horon the upper;
Joshua 16:6	and the border went out westward at Michmethath on the north; and the border turned about eastward unto Taanath-shiloh, and passed along it on the east of Janoah;
Joshua 16:7	and it went down from Janoah to Ataroth, and to Naarah, and reached unto Jericho, and went out at Jordan.
Joshua 16:8	From Tappuah the border went along westward to the brook of Kanah; and the goings out thereof were at the sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim according to their families;
Joshua 16:9	together with the cities which were separated for the children of Ephraim in the midst of the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages.
Joshua 16:10	And they drave not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer: but the Canaanites dwelt in the midst of Ephraim, unto this day, and became servants to do taskwork.
Joshua 17:1	And this was the lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the firstborn of Joseph. As for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.
Joshua 17:2	And the lot was for the rest of the children of Manasseh according to their families; for the children of Abiezer, and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida: these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph according to their families.
Joshua 17:3	But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters: and these are the names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
Joshua 17:4	And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren: therefore according to the commandment of the LORD he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father.
Joshua 17:5	And there fell ten parts to Manasseh, beside the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is beyond Jordan;
Joshua 17:6	because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons: and the land of Gilead belonged unto the rest of the sons of Manasseh.
Joshua 17:7	And the border of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethath, which is before Shechem; and the border went along to the right hand, unto the inhabitants of En-tappuah.
Joshua 17:8	The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh: but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim.
Joshua 17:9	And the border went down unto the brook of Kanah, southward of the brook: these cities belonged to Ephraim among the cities of Manasseh: and the border of Manasseh was on the north side of the brook, and the goings out thereof were at the sea:
Joshua 17:10	southward it was Ephraim’s, and northward it was Manasseh’s, and the sea was his border; and they reached to Asher on the north, and to Issachar on the east.
Joshua 17:11	And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Beth-shean and her towns, and Ibleam and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, and the inhabitants of En-dor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and her towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns, even the three heights.
Joshua 17:12	Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.
Joshua 17:13	And it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxen strong, that they put the Canaanites to taskwork, and did not utterly drive them out.
Joshua 17:14	And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast thou given me but one lot and one part for an inheritance, seeing I am a great people, forasmuch as hitherto the LORD hath blessed me?
Joshua 17:15	And Joshua said unto them, If thou be a great people, get thee up to the forest, and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the Rephaim; since the hill country of Ephraim is too narrow for thee.
Joshua 17:16	And the children of Joseph said, The hill country is not enough for us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both they who are in Beth-shean and her towns, and they who are in the valley of Jezreel.
Joshua 17:17	And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, Thou art a great people, and hast great power: thou shalt not have one lot only:
Joshua 17:18	but the hill country shall be thine; for though it is a forest, thou shalt cut it down, and the goings out thereof shall be thine: for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites, though they have chariots of iron, and though they be strong.
Joshua 18:1	And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled themselves together at Shiloh, and set up the tent of meeting there: and the land was subdued before them.
Joshua 18:2	And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes, which had not yet divided their inheritance.
Joshua 18:3	And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long are ye slack to go in to possess the land, which the LORD, the God of your fathers, hath given you?
Joshua 18:4	Appoint for you three men for each tribe: and I will send them, and they shall arise, and walk through the land, and describe it according to their inheritance; and they shall come unto me.
Joshua 18:5	And they shall divide it into seven portions: Judah shall abide in his border on the south, and the house of Joseph shall abide in their border on the north.
Joshua 18:6	And ye shall describe the land into seven portions, and bring the description hither to me: and I will cast lots for you here before the LORD our God.
Joshua 18:7	For the Levites have no portion among you; for the priesthood of the LORD is their inheritance: and Gad and Reuben and the half tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance beyond Jordan eastward, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them.
Joshua 18:8	And the men arose, and went: and Joshua charged them that went to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land, and describe it, and come again to me, and I will cast lots for you here before the LORD in Shiloh.
Joshua 18:9	And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by cities into seven portions in a book, and they came to Joshua unto the camp at Shiloh.
Joshua 18:10	And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD: and there Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel according to their divisions.
Joshua 18:11	And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families: and the border of their lot went out between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.
Joshua 18:12	And their border on the north quarter was from Jordan; and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north, and went up through the hill country westward; and the goings out thereof were at the wilderness of Beth-aven.
Joshua 18:13	And the border passed along from thence to Luz, to the side of Luz (the same is Beth-el), southward; and the border went down to Ataroth-addar, by the mountain that lieth on the south of Beth-horon the nether.
Joshua 18:14	And the border was drawn and turned about on the west quarter southward, from the mountain that lieth before Beth-horon southward; and the goings out thereof were at Kirjath-baal (the same is Kiriath-jearim), a city of the children of Judah: this was the west quarter.
Joshua 18:15	And the south quarter was from the uttermost part of Kirjath-jearim, and the border went out westward, and went out to the fountain of the waters of Nephtoah:
Joshua 18:16	and the border went down to the uttermost part of the mountain that lieth before the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is in the vale of Rephaim northward; and it went down to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of the Jebusite southward, and went down to En-rogel;
Joshua 18:17	and it was drawn on the north, and went out at En-shemesh, and went out to Geliloth, which is over against the ascent of Adummim; and it went down to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben;
Joshua 18:18	and it passed along to the side over against the Arabah northward, and went down unto the Arabah:
Joshua 18:19	and the border passed along to the side of Beth-hoglah northward: and the goings out of the border were at the north bay of the Salt Sea, at the south end of Jordan: this was the south border.
Joshua 18:20	And Jordan was the border of it on the east quarter. This was the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the borders thereof round about, according to their families.
Joshua 18:21	Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, and Beth-hoglah, and Emek-keziz;

Joshua 19:9	Out of the part of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon: for the portion of the children of Judah was too much for them: therefore the children of Simeon had inheritance in the midst of their inheritance.
Joshua 19:10	And the third lot came up for the children of Zebulun according to their families: and the border of their inheritance was unto Sarid:
Joshua 19:11	and their border went up westward, even to Maralah, and reached to Dabbesheth; and it reached to the brook that is before Jokneam;
Joshua 19:12	and it turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrising unto the border of Chisloth-tabor; and it went out to Daberath, and went up to Japhia;
Joshua 19:13	and from thence it passed along eastward to Gath-hepher, to Ethkazin; and it went out at Rimmon which stretcheth unto Neah;

Joshua 19:25	And their border was Helkath, and Hali, and Beten, and Achshaph,
Joshua 19:26	and Allammelech, and Amad, and Mishal; and it reached to Carmel westward, and to Shihor-libnath;
Joshua 19:27	and it turned toward the sunrising to Beth-dagon, and reached to Zebulun, and to the valley of Iphtah-el northward to Beth-emek and Neiel; and it went out to Cabul on the left hand,
Joshua 19:28	and Ebron, and Rehob, and Hammon, and Kanah, even unto great Zidon;
Joshua 19:29	and the border turned to Ramah, and to the fenced city of Tyre; and the border turned to Hosah; and the goings out thereof were at the sea by the region of Achzib:

Joshua 19:31	This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families, these cities with their villages.
Joshua 19:32	The sixth lot came out for the children of Naphtali, even for the children of Naphtali according to their families.
Joshua 19:33	And their border was from Heleph, from the oak in Zaanannim, and Adami-nekeb, and Jabneel, unto Lakkum; and the goings out thereof were at Jordan:
Joshua 19:34	and the border turned westward to Aznoth-tabor, and went out from thence to Hukkok; and it reached to Zebulun on the south, and reached to Asher on the west, and to Judah at Jordan toward the sunrising.
Joshua 19:35	And the fenced cities were Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath, and Chinnereth;
Joshua 19:36	and Adamah, and Ramah, and Hazor;
Joshua 19:37	and Kedesh, and Edrei, and En-hazor;

Joshua 19:46	and Me-jarkon, and Rakkon, with the border over against Joppa.
Joshua 19:47	And the border of the children of Dan went out beyond them: for the children of Dan went up and fought against Leshem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and dwelt therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father.
Joshua 19:48	This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages.
Joshua 19:49	So they made an end of distributing the land for inheritance by the borders thereof; and the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua me son of Nun in the midst of them:
Joshua 19:50	according to the commandment of the LORD they gave him the city which he asked, even Timnath-serah in the hill country of Ephraim: and he built the city, and dwelt therein.
Joshua 19:51	These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers’ houses of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance by lot in Shiloh before the LORD, at the door of the tent of meeting. So they made an end of dividing the land.
Joshua 20:1	And the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying,
Joshua 20:2	Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Assign you the cities of refuge, whereof I spake unto you by the hand of Moses:
Joshua 20:3	that the manslayer that killeth any person unwittingly and unawares may flee thither: and they shall be unto you for a refuge from the avenger of blood.
Joshua 20:4	And he shall flee unto one of those cities, and shall stand at the entering of the gate of the city, and declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city; and they shall take him into the city unto them, and give him a place, that he may dwell among them.
Joshua 20:5	And if the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall not deliver up the manslayer into his hand; because he smote his neighbour unawares, and hated him not beforetime.
Joshua 20:6	And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the congregation for judgment, until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days: then shall the manslayer return, and come unto his own city, and unto his own house, unto the city from whence he fled.
Joshua 20:7	And they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali, and Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and Kiriath-arba (the same is Hebron) in the hill country of Judah.
Joshua 20:8	And beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness in the plain out of the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh.
Joshua 20:9	These were the appointed cities for all the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them, that whosoever killeth any person unwittingly might flee thither, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he stood before the congregation.
Joshua 21:1	Then came near the heads of fathers’ houses of the Levites unto Eleazar the priest, and unto Joshua the son of Nun, and unto the heads of fathers’ houses of the tribes of the children of Israel;
Joshua 21:2	and they spake unto them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, The LORD commanded by the hand of Moses to give us cities to dwell in, with the suburbs thereof for our cattle.
Joshua 21:3	And the children of Israel gave unto the Levites out of their inheritance, according to the commandment of the LORD, these cities with their suburbs.
Joshua 21:4	And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites: and the children of Aaron the priest, which were of the Levites, had by lot out of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of the Simeonites, and out of the tribe of Benjamin, thirteen cities.
Joshua 21:5	And the rest of the children of Kohath had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Ephraim, and out of the tribe of Dan, and out of the half tribe of Manasseh, ten cities.

Joshua 21:9	And they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities which are here mentioned by name:
Joshua 21:10	and they were for the children of Aaron, of the families of the Kohathites, who were of the children of Levi: for theirs was the first lot.
Joshua 21:11	And they gave them Kiriath-arba, which Arba was the father of Anak, (the same is Hebron,) in the hill country of Judah, with the suburbs thereof round about it.
Joshua 21:12	But the fields of the city, and the villages thereof, gave they to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession.
Joshua 21:13	And unto the children of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron with her suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Libnah with her suburbs;

Joshua 21:15	and Holon with her suburbs, and Debir with her suburbs;
Joshua 21:16	and Ain with her suburbs, and Juttah with her suburbs, and Beth-shemesh with her suburbs; nine cities out of those two tribes.

Joshua 21:18	Anathoth with her suburbs, and Almon with her suburbs; four cities.
Joshua 21:19	All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests, were thirteen cities with their suburbs.
Joshua 21:20	And the families of the children of Kohath, the Levites, even the rest of the children of Kohath, they had the cities of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim.
Joshua 21:21	And they gave them Shechem with her suburbs in the hill country of Ephraim, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Gezer with her suburbs;

Joshua 21:38	And out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with her suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Mahanaim with her suburbs;
Joshua 21:39	Heshbon with her suburbs, Jazer with her suburbs; four cities in all.
Joshua 21:40	All these were the cities of the children of Merari according to their families, even the rest of the families of the Levites; and their lot was twelve cities.
Joshua 21:41	All the cities of the Levites in the midst of the possession of the children of Israel were forty and eight cities with their suburbs.
Joshua 21:42	These cities were every one with their suburbs round about them: thus it was with all these cities.
Joshua 21:43	So the LORD gave unto Israel all the land which he sware to give unto their fathers; and they possessed it, and dwelt therein.
Joshua 21:44	And the LORD gave them rest round about, according to all that he sware unto their fathers: and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them; the LORD delivered all their enemies into their hand.
Joshua 21:45	There failed not aught of any good thing which the LORD had spoken unto the house of Israel; all came to pass.
Joshua 22:1	Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh,
Joshua 22:2	and said unto them, Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, and have hearkened unto my voice in all that I commanded you:
Joshua 22:3	ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of the LORD your God.
Joshua 22:4	And now the LORD your God hath given rest unto your brethren, as he spake unto them: therefore now turn ye, and get you unto your tents, unto the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you beyond Jordan.
Joshua 22:5	Only take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law, which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, to love the LORD your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to cleave unto him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul.
Joshua 22:6	So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away: and they went unto their tents.
Joshua 22:7	Now to the one half tribe of Manasseh Moses had given inheritance in Bashan: but unto the other half gave Joshua among their brethren beyond Jordan westward. Moreover when Joshua sent them away unto their tents, he blessed them,
Joshua 22:8	and spake unto them, saying, Return with much wealth unto your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren.
Joshua 22:9	And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go unto the land of Gilead, to the land of their possession, whereof they were possessed, according to the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.
Joshua 22:10	And when they came unto the region about Jordan, that is in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan, a great altar to see to.
Joshua 22:11	And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh have built an altar in the forefront of the land of Canaan, in the region about Jordan, on the side that pertaineth to the children of Israel.
Joshua 22:12	And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up against them to war.
Joshua 22:13	And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest;
Joshua 22:14	and with him ten princes, one prince of a fathers’ house for each of the tribes of Israel; and they were every one of them head of their fathers’ houses among the thousands of Israel.
Joshua 22:15	And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of Gilead, and they spake with them, saying,
Joshua 22:16	Thus saith the whole congregation of the LORD, What trespass is this that ye have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from following the LORD, in that ye have builded you an altar, to rebel this day against the LORD?
Joshua 22:17	Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we have not cleansed ourselves unto this day, although there came a plague upon the congregation of the LORD,
Joshua 22:18	that ye must turn away this day from following the LORD? and it will be, seeing ye rebel today against the LORD, that tomorrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of Israel.
Joshua 22:19	Howbeit, if the land of your possession be unclean, then pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the LORD, wherein the LORD’S tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession among us: but rebel not against the LORD, nor rebel against us, in building you an altar besides the altar of the LORD our God.
Joshua 22:20	Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the devoted thing, and wrath fell upon all the congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity.
Joshua 22:21	Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh answered, and spake unto the heads of the thousands of Israel,
Joshua 22:22	The LORD, the God of gods, the LORD, the God of gods, he knoweth, and Israel he shall know; if it be in rebellion, or if in trespass against the LORD, (save thou us not this day,)
Joshua 22:23	that we have built us an altar to turn away from following the LORD; or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meal offering, or if to offer sacrifices of peace offerings thereon, let the LORD himself require it;
Joshua 22:24	and if we have not rather out of carefulness done this, and of purpose, saying, In time to come your children might speak unto our children, saying, What have ye to do with the LORD, the God of Israel?
Joshua 22:25	for the LORD hath made Jordan a border between us and you, ye children of Reuben and children of Gad; ye have no portion in the LORD: so shall your children make our children cease from fearing the LORD.
Joshua 22:26	Therefore we said, Let as now prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice:
Joshua 22:27	but it shall be a witness between us and you, and between our generations after us, that we may do the service of the LORD before him with our burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace offerings; that your children may not say to our children in time to come, Ye have no portion in the LORD.
Joshua 22:28	Therefore said we, It shall be, when they so say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we shall say, Behold the pattern of the altar of the LORD, which our fathers made, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice; but it is a witness between us and you.
Joshua 22:29	God forbid that we should rebel against the LORD, and turn away this day from following the LORD, to build an altar for burnt offering, for meal offering, or for sacrifice, besides the altar of the LORD our God that is before his tabernacle.
Joshua 22:30	And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation, even the heads of the thousands of Israel which were with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spake, it pleased them well.
Joshua 22:31	And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, This day we know that the LORD is in the midst of us, because ye have not committed this trespass against the LORD: now have ye delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the LORD.
Joshua 22:32	And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again.
Joshua 22:33	And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and spake no more of going up against them to war, to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and the children of Gad dwelt.
Joshua 22:34	And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar Ed: For, said they, it is a witness between us that the LORD is God.
Joshua 23:1	And it came to pass after many days, when the LORD had given rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about, and Joshua was old and well stricken in years;
Joshua 23:2	that Joshua called for all Israel, for their elders and for their heads, and for their judges and for their officers, and said unto them, I am old and well stricken in years:
Joshua 23:3	and ye have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto all these nations because of you; for the LORD your God, he it is that hath fought for you.
Joshua 23:4	Behold, I have allotted unto you these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun.
Joshua 23:5	And the LORD your God, he shall thrust them out from before you, and drive them from out of your sight; and ye shall possess their land, as the LORD your God spake unto you.
Joshua 23:6	Therefore be ye very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left;
Joshua 23:7	that ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow down yourselves unto them:
Joshua 23:8	but cleave unto the LORD your God, as ye have done unto this day.
Joshua 23:9	For the LORD hath driven out from before you great nations and strong: but as for you, no man hath stood before you unto this day.
Joshua 23:10	One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the LORD your God, he it is that fighteth for you, as he spake unto you.
Joshua 23:11	Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love the LORD your God.
Joshua 23:12	Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant of these nations, even these that remain among you, and make marriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to you:
Joshua 23:13	know for a certainty that the LORD your God will no more drive these nations from out of your sight; but they shall be a snare and a trap unto you, and a scourge in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you.
Joshua 23:14	And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth: and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the LORD your God spake concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, not one thing hath failed thereof.
Joshua 23:15	And it shall come to pass, that as all the good things are come upon you of which the LORD your God spake unto you, so shall the LORD bring upon you all the evil things, until he have destroyed you from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you.
Joshua 23:16	When ye transgress the covenant of the LORD your God, which he commanded you, and go and serve other gods, and bow down yourselves to them; then shall the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given unto you.
Joshua 24:1	And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before God.
Joshua 24:2	And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt of old time beyond the River, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nahor: and they served other gods.
Joshua 24:3	And I took your father Abraham from beyond the River, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac.
Joshua 24:4	And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau mount Seir, to possess it; and Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.
Joshua 24:5	And I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did in the midst thereof: and afterward I brought you out.
Joshua 24:6	And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and with horsemen unto the Red Sea.
Joshua 24:7	And when they cried out unto the LORD, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes saw what I did in Egypt: and ye dwelt in the wilderness many days.
Joshua 24:8	And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt beyond Jordan; and they fought with you: and I gave them into your hand, and ye possessed their land; and I destroyed them from before you.
Joshua 24:9	Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel; and he sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you:
Joshua 24:10	but I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out of his hand.
Joshua 24:11	And ye went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Girgashite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; and I delivered them into your hand.
Joshua 24:12	And I sent the hornet before you, which drave them out from before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; not with thy sword, nor with thy bow.
Joshua 24:13	And I gave you a land whereon thou hadst not laboured, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwell therein; of vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat.
Joshua 24:14	Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served beyond the River, and in Egypt; and serve ye the LORD.
Joshua 24:15	And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.
Joshua 24:16	And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should forsake the LORD, to serve other gods;
Joshua 24:17	for the LORD our God, he it is that brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and that did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way wherein we went, and among all the peoples through the midst of whom we passed:
Joshua 24:18	and the LORD drave out from before us all the peoples, even the Amorites which dwelt in the land: therefore we also will serve the LORD; for he is our God.
Joshua 24:19	And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the LORD; for he is an holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgression nor your sins.
Joshua 24:20	If ye forsake the LORD, and serve strange gods, then he will turn and do you evil, and consume you, after that he hath done you good.
Joshua 24:21	And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the LORD.
Joshua 24:22	And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the LORD, to serve him. And they said, We are witnesses.
Joshua 24:23	Now therefore put away, said he, the strange gods which are among you, and incline your heart unto the LORD, the God of Israel.
Joshua 24:24	And the people said unto Joshua, The LORD our God will we serve, and unto his voice will we hearken.
Joshua 24:25	So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.
Joshua 24:26	And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God; and he took a great stone, and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of the LORD.
Joshua 24:27	And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness against us; for it hath heard all the words of the LORD which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness against you, lest ye deny your God.
Joshua 24:28	So Joshua sent the people away, every man unto his inheritance.
Joshua 24:29	And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years old.
Joshua 24:30	And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-serah, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaash.
Joshua 24:31	And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, and had known all the work of the LORD, that he had wrought for Israel.
Joshua 24:32	And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in the parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of money: and they became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.
Joshua 24:33	And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in the hill of Phinehas his son, which was given him in the hill country of Ephraim.
Judges 1:1	And it came to pass after the death of Joshua, that the children of Israel asked of the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us first against the Canaanites, to fight against them?
Judges 1:2	And the LORD said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.
Judges 1:3	And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.
Judges 1:4	And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they smote of them in Bezek ten thousand men.
Judges 1:5	And they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they smote the Canaanites and the Perizzites.
Judges 1:6	But Adoni-bezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.
Judges 1:7	And Adoni-bezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table: as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.
Judges 1:8	And the children of Judah fought against Jerusalem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.
Judges 1:9	And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites that dwelt in the hill country, and in the South, and in the lowland.
Judges 1:10	And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron beforetime was Kiriath-arba:) and they smote Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.
Judges 1:11	And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir. (Now the name of Debir beforetime was Kiriath-sepher.)
Judges 1:12	And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kiriath-sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.
Judges 1:13	And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.
Judges 1:14	And it came to pass, when she came unto him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted down from off her ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wouldest thou?
Judges 1:15	And she said unto him, Give me a blessing; for that thou hast set me in the land of the South, give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.
Judges 1:16	And the children of the Kenite, Moses’ brother in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which is in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt with the people.
Judges 1:17	And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they smote the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah.
Judges 1:18	Also Judah took Gaza with the border thereof, and Ashkelon with the border thereof, and Ekron with the border thereof.
Judges 1:19	And the LORD was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants of the hill country; for he could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.
Judges 1:20	And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses had spoken: and he drave out thence the three sons of Anak.
Judges 1:21	And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem: but the Jebusites dwelt with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem, unto this day.
Judges 1:22	And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Beth-el: and the LORD was with them.
Judges 1:23	And the house of Joseph sent to spy out Beth-el. (Now the name of the city beforetime was Luz.)
Judges 1:24	And the watchers saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will deal kindly with thee.
Judges 1:25	And he shewed them the entrance into the city, and they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let the man go and all his family.
Judges 1:26	And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz: which is the name thereof unto this day.
Judges 1:27	And Manasseh did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shean and her towns, nor of Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.
Judges 1:28	And it came to pass, when Israel was waxen strong, that they put the Canaanites to taskwork, and did not utterly drive them out.
Judges 1:29	And Ephraim drave not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.
Judges 1:30	Zebulun drave not out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became tributary.
Judges 1:31	Asher drave not out the inhabitants of Acco, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob:
Judges 1:32	but the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them out.
Judges 1:33	Naphtali drave not out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became tributary unto them.
Judges 1:34	And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the hill country: for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley:
Judges 1:35	but the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributary.
Judges 1:36	And the border of the Amorites was from the ascent of Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.
Judges 2:1	And the angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim. And he said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto the land which I sware unto your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you:
Judges 2:2	and ye shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall break down their altars: but ye have not hearkened unto my voice: why have ye done this?
Judges 2:3	Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you.
Judges 2:4	And it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spake these words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.
Judges 2:5	And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there unto the LORD.
Judges 2:6	Now when Joshua had sent the people away, the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land.
Judges 2:7	And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work of the LORD, that he had wrought for Israel.
Judges 2:8	And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years old.
Judges 2:9	And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaash.
Judges 2:10	And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the LORD, nor yet the work which he had wrought for Israel.
Judges 2:11	And the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, and served the Baalim:
Judges 2:12	and they forsook the LORD, the God of their fathers, which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the peoples that were round about them, and bowed themselves down unto them: and they provoked the LORD to anger.
Judges 2:13	And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and the Ashtaroth.
Judges 2:14	And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.
Judges 2:15	Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil, as the LORD had spoken, and as the LORD had sworn unto them: and they were sore distressed.
Judges 2:16	And the LORD raised up judges, which saved them out of the hand of those that spoiled them.
Judges 2:17	And yet they hearkened not unto their judges, for they went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves down unto them: they turned aside quickly out of the way wherein their fathers walked, obeying the commandments of the LORD; but they did not so.
Judges 2:18	And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with the judge, and saved them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the LORD because of their groaning by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them.
Judges 2:19	But it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they turned back, and dealt more corruptly than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them; they ceased not from their doings, nor from their stubborn way.
Judges 2:20	And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel; and he said, Because this nation have transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice;
Judges 2:21	I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations which Joshua left when he died:
Judges 2:22	that by them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk therein, as their fathers did keep it, or not.
Judges 2:23	So the LORD left those nations, without driving them out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua.
Judges 3:1	Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by them, even as many as had not known all the wars of Canaan;
Judges 3:2	only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as beforetime knew nothing thereof;
Judges 3:3	namely, the five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Zidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon unto the entering in of Hamath.
Judges 3:4	And they were for to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.
Judges 3:5	And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites; the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite:
Judges 3:6	and they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their own daughters to their sons, and served their gods.
Judges 3:7	And the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgat the LORD their God, and served the Baalim and the Asheroth.
Judges 3:8	Therefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Cushan-rishathaim eight years.
Judges 3:9	And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised up a saviour to the children of Israel, who saved them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother.
Judges 3:10	And the spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel; and he went out to war, and the LORD delivered Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand: and his hand prevailed against Cushan-rishathaim.
Judges 3:11	And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.
Judges 3:12	And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done that which was evil in the sight of the LORD.
Judges 3:13	And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek; and went and smote Israel, and they possessed the city of palm trees.
Judges 3:14	And the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.
Judges 3:15	But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised them up a saviour, Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and the children of Israel sent a present by him unto Eglon the king of Moab.
Judges 3:16	And Ehud made him a sword which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he girded it under his raiment upon his right thigh.
Judges 3:17	And he offered the present unto Eglon king of Moab: now Eglon was a very fat man.
Judges 3:18	And when he had made an end of offering the present, he sent away the people that bare the present.
Judges 3:19	But he himself turned back from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king. And he said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.
Judges 3:20	And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting by himself alone in his summer parlour. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat.
Judges 3:21	And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:
Judges 3:22	and the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, for he drew not the sword out of his belly; and it came out behind.
Judges 3:23	Then Ehud went forth into the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them.
Judges 3:24	Now when he was gone out, his servants came; and they saw, and, behold, the doors of the parlour were locked; and they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber.
Judges 3:25	And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took the key, and opened them: and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.
Judges 3:26	And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirah.
Judges 3:27	And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the hill country, and he before them.
Judges 3:28	And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan against the Moabites, and suffered not a man to pass over.
Judges 3:29	And they smote of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, every lusty man, and every man of valour; and there escaped not a man.
Judges 3:30	So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.
Judges 3:31	And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which smote of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also saved Israel.
Judges 4:1	And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, when Ehud was dead.
Judges 4:2	And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, which dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles.
Judges 4:3	And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel.
Judges 4:4	Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, she judged Israel at that time.
Judges 4:5	And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Beth-el in the hill country of Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.
Judges 4:6	Ands she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh-naphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the LORD, the God of Israel, commanded, saying, Go and draw unto mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun?
Judges 4:7	And I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera, the captain of Jabin’s army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into thine hand.
Judges 4:8	And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go: but if thou wilt not go with me, I will not go.
Judges 4:9	And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour; for the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.
Judges 4:10	And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh; and there went up ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.
Judges 4:11	Now Heber the Kenite had severed himself from the Kenites, even from the children of Hobab the brother in law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far as the oak in Zaanannim, which is by Kedesh.
Judges 4:12	And they told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor.
Judges 4:13	And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles, unto the river Kishon.
Judges 4:14	And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in which the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thine hand: is not the LORD gone out before thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.
Judges 4:15	And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; and Sisera lighted down from his chariot, and fled away on his feet.
Judges 4:16	But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; there was not a man left.
Judges 4:17	Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.
Judges 4:18	And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And he turned in unto her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug.
Judges 4:19	And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.
Judges 4:20	And he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man doth come and inquire of thee, and say, Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No.
Judges 4:21	Then Jael Heber’s wife took a tent-pin, and took an hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the pin into his temples, and it pierced through into the ground; for he was in a deep sleep; so he swooned and died.
Judges 4:22	And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said unto him, Come, and I will shew thee the man whom thou seekest. And he came unto her; and, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the tent-pin was in his temples.
Judges 4:23	So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel.
Judges 4:24	And the hand of the children of Israel prevailed more and more against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.
Judges 5:1	Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying,
Judges 5:2	For that the leaders took the lead in Israel, for that the people offered themselves willingly, bless ye the LORD.
Judges 5:3	Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, even I, will sing unto the LORD; I will sing praise to the LORD, the God of Israel.
Judges 5:4	LORD, when thou wentest forth out of Seir, when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, the heavens also dropped, yea, the clouds dropped water.
Judges 5:5	The mountains flowed down at the presence of the LORD, even yon Sinai at the presence of the LORD, the God of Israel.
Judges 5:6	In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travellers walked through byways.
Judges 5:7	The rulers ceased in Israel, they ceased, until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.
Judges 5:8	They chose new gods; then was war in the gates: was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?
Judges 5:9	My heart is toward the governors of Israel, that offered themselves willingly among the people: bless ye the LORD.
Judges 5:10	Tell of it, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit on rich carpets, and ye that walk by the way.
Judges 5:11	Far from the noise of archers, in the places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the LORD, even the righteous acts of his rule in Israel. Then the people of the LORD went down to the gates.
Judges 5:12	Awake, awake, Deborah; awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.
Judges 5:13	Then came down a remnant of the nobles and the people; the LORD came down for me against the mighty.
Judges 5:14	Out of Ephraim came down they whose root is in Amalek; after thee, Benjamin, among thy peoples; out of Machir came down governors, and out of Zebulun they that handle the marshal’s staff.
Judges 5:15	And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; as was Issachar, so was Barak; into the valley they rushed forth at his feet. By the watercourses of Reuben there were great resolves of heart.
Judges 5:16	Why satest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the pipings for the flocks? At the watercourses of Reuben there were great searchings of heart.
Judges 5:17	Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and Dan, why did he remain in ships? Asher sat still at the haven of the sea, and abode by his creeks.
Judges 5:18	Zebulun was a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death, and Naphtali, upon the high places of the field.
Judges 5:19	The kings came and fought; then fought the kings of Canaan; in Taanach by the waters of Meggido: they took no gain of money.
Judges 5:20	They fought from heaven, the stars in their courses fought against Sisera.
Judges 5:21	The river Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river Kishon. O my soul, march on with strength.
Judges 5:22	Then did the horsehoofs stamp by reason of the pransings, the pransings of their strong ones.
Judges 5:23	Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help of the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty.
Judges 5:24	Blessed above women shall Jael be, the wife of Heber the Kenite, blessed shall she be above women in the tent.
Judges 5:25	He asked water, and she gave him milk; she brought him butter in a lordly dish.
Judges 5:26	She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen’s hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote through his head, yea, she pierced and struck through his temples.
Judges 5:27	At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay: at her feet he bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead.
Judges 5:28	Through the window she looked forth, and cried, the mother of Sisera cried through the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? why tarry the wheels of his chariots?
Judges 5:29	Her wise ladies answered her, yea, she returned answer to herself,
Judges 5:30	Have they not found, have they not divided the spoil? a damsel, two damsels to every man; to Sisera a spoil of divers colours, a spoil of divers colours of embroidery, of divers colours of embroidery on both sides, on the necks of the spoil?
Judges 5:31	So let all thine enemies perish, O LORD: but let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might. And the land had rest forty years.
Judges 6:1	And the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.
Judges 6:2	And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: and because of Midian the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains, and the caves, and the strong holds.
Judges 6:3	And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east; they came up against them;
Judges 6:4	and they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance in Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.
Judges 6:5	For they came up with their cattle and their tents, they came in as locusts for multitude; both they and their camels were without number: and they came into the land to destroy it.
Judges 6:6	And Israel was brought very low because of Midian; and the children of Israel cried unto the LORD.
Judges 6:7	And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD because of Midian,
Judges 6:8	that the LORD sent a prophet unto the children of Israel: and he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage;
Judges 6:9	and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drave them out from before you, and gave you their land;
Judges 6:10	and I said unto you, I am the LORD your God; ye shall not fear the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but ye have not hearkened unto my voice.
Judges 6:11	And the angel of the LORD came and sat under the oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash the Abiezrite: and his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress, to hide it from the Midianites.
Judges 6:12	And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him, and said unto him, The LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour.
Judges 6:13	And Gideon said unto him, Oh my lord, if the LORD be with us, why then is all this befallen us? and where be all his wondrous works which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt? but now the LORD hath cast us off, and delivered us into the hand of Midian.
Judges 6:14	And the LORD looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and save Israel from the hand of Midian: have not I sent thee?
Judges 6:15	And he said unto him, Oh Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel? behold, my family is the poorest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father’s house.
Judges 6:16	And the LORD said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man.
Judges 6:17	And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, then shew me a sign that it is thou that talkest with me.
Judges 6:18	Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring forth my present, and lay it before thee. And he said, I will tarry until thou come again.
Judges 6:19	And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of meal: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out unto him under the oak, and presented it.
Judges 6:20	And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so.
Judges 6:21	Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there went up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and the angel of the LORD departed out of his sight.
Judges 6:22	And Gideon saw that he was the angel of the LORD; and Gideon said, Alas, O Lord GOD! forasmuch as I have seen the angel of the LORD face to face.
Judges 6:23	And the LORD said unto him, Peace be unto thee; fear not: thou shalt not die.
Judges 6:24	Then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD, and called it Jehovah-shalom: unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
Judges 6:25	And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Take thy father’s bullock, even the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut down the Asherah that is by it:
Judges 6:26	and build an altar unto the LORD thy God upon the top of this strong hold, in the orderly manner, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah which thou shalt cut down.
Judges 6:27	Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD had spoken unto him: and it came to pass, because he feared his father’s household and the men of the city, so that he could not do it by day, that he did it by night.
Judges 6:28	And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was broken down, and the Asherah was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built.
Judges 6:29	And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when they inquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing.
Judges 6:30	Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may die: because he hath broken down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the Asherah that was by it.
Judges 6:31	And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead for Baal? or will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to death whilst it is yet morning: if he be a god, let him plead for himself, because one hath broken down his altar.
Judges 6:32	Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead against him, because he hath broken down his altar.
Judges 6:33	Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east assembled themselves together; and they passed over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel
Judges 6:34	But the spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon; and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered together after him.
Judges 6:35	And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; and they also were gathered together after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.
Judges 6:36	And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast spoken,
Judges 6:37	behold, I will put a fleece of wool on the threshing-floor; if there be dew on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the ground, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast spoken.
Judges 6:38	And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and pressed the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowlful of water.
Judges 6:39	And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be kindled against me, and I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.
Judges 6:40	And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.
Judges 7:1	Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with him, rose up early, and pitched beside the spring of Harod: and the camp of Midian was on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.
Judges 7:2	And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hand, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me.
Judges 7:3	Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever is fearful and trembling, let him return and depart from mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.
Judges 7:4	And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there: and it shall be, that of whom I say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.
Judges 7:5	So he brought down the people unto the water: and the LORD said unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink.
Judges 7:6	And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.
Judges 7:7	And the LORD said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine hand: and let all the people go every man unto his place.
Judges 7:8	So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent all the men of Israel every man unto his tent, but retained the three hundred men: and the camp of Midian was beneath him in the valley.
Judges 7:9	And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Arise, get thee down into the camp; for I have delivered it into thine hand.
Judges 7:10	But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Purah thy servant down to the camp:
Judges 7:11	and thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down into the camp. Then went he down with Purah his servant unto the outermost part of the armed men that were in the camp.
Judges 7:12	And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like locusts for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand which is upon the sea shore for multitude.
Judges 7:13	And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian, and came unto the tent, and smote it that it fell, and turned it upside down, that the tent lay along.
Judges 7:14	And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: into his hand God hath delivered Midian, and all the host.
Judges 7:15	And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped; and he returned into the camp of Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian.
Judges 7:16	And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put into the hands of all of them trumpets, and empty pitchers, with torches within the pitchers.
Judges 7:17	And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outermost part of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall ye do.
Judges 7:18	When I blow the trumpet, I and all that are with me, then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, For the LORD and for Gideon.
Judges 7:19	So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the outermost part of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch, when they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and brake in pieces the pitchers that were in their hands.
Judges 7:20	And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers, and held the torches in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow withal: and they cried, The sword of the LORD and of Gideon.
Judges 7:21	And they stood every man in his place round about the camp: and all the host ran; and they shouted, and put them to flight.
Judges 7:22	And they blew the three hundred trumpets, and the LORD set every man’s sword against his fellow, and against all the host: and the host fled as far as Beth-shittah toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel-meholah, by Tabbath.
Judges 7:23	And the men of Israel were gathered together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after Midian.
Judges 7:24	And Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country of Ephraim, saying, Come down against Midian, and take before them the waters, as far as Beth-barah, even Jordan. So all the men of Ephraim were gathered together, and took the waters as far as Beth-barah, even Jordan.
Judges 7:25	And they took the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian: and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon beyond Jordan.
Judges 8:1	And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us thus, that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight with Midian? And they did chide with him sharply.
Judges 8:2	And he said unto them, What have I now done in comparison of you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?
Judges 8:3	God hath delivered into your hand the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.
Judges 8:4	And Gideon came to Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing.
Judges 8:5	And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread unto the people that follow me; for they be faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.
Judges 8:6	And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thine army?
Judges 8:7	And Gideon said: Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into mine hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.
Judges 8:8	And he went up thence to Penuel, and spake unto them in like manner: and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered.
Judges 8:9	And he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.
Judges 8:10	Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the host of the children of the east: for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword.
Judges 8:11	And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host; for the host was secure.
Judges 8:12	And Zebah and Zalmunna fled; and he pursued after them; and he took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the host.
Judges 8:13	And Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle from the ascent of Heres.
Judges 8:14	And he caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and inquired of him: and he described for him the princes of Succoth, and the elders thereof, seventy and seven men.
Judges 8:15	And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, concerning whom ye did taunt me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thy men that are weary?
Judges 8:16	And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.
Judges 8:17	And he brake down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city.
Judges 8:18	Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were they whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou art, so were they; each one resembled the children of a king.
Judges 8:19	And he said, They were my brethren, the sons of my mother: as the LORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you.
Judges 8:20	And he said unto Jether his firstborn, Up, and slay them. But the youth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he was yet a youth.
Judges 8:21	Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for as the man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescents that were on their camels’ necks.
Judges 8:22	Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son’s son also: for thou hast saved us out of the hand of Midian.
Judges 8:23	And Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the LORD shall rule over you.
Judges 8:24	And Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you, that ye would give me every man the earrings of his spoil. (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)
Judges 8:25	And they answered, We will willingly give them. And they spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the earrings of his spoil.
Judges 8:26	And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; beside the crescents, and the pendants, and the purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, and beside the chains that were about their camels’ necks.
Judges 8:27	And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah: and all Israel went a whoring after it there: and it became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house.
Judges 8:28	So Midian was subdued before the children of Israel, and they lifted up their heads no more. And the land had rest forty years in the days of Gideon.
Judges 8:29	And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house.
Judges 8:30	And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten: for he had many wives.
Judges 8:31	And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a son, and he called his name Abimelech.
Judges 8:32	And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
Judges 8:33	And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and went a whoring after the Baalim, and made Baal-berith their god.
Judges 8:34	And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God, who had delivered them out of the hand of all their enemies on every side:
Judges 8:35	neither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had shewed unto Israel.
Judges 9:1	And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother’s brethren, and spake with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother’s father, saying,
Judges 9:2	Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether is better for you that all the sons of Jerubbaal, which are threescore and ten persons, rule over you, or that one rule over you? remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.
Judges 9:3	And his mother’s brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, He is our brother.
Judges 9:4	And they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the house of Baal-berith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light fellows, which followed him.
Judges 9:5	And he went unto his father’s house at Ophrah, and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, being threescore and ten persons, upon one stone: but Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself.
Judges 9:6	And all the men of Shechem assembled themselves together, and all the house of Millo, and went and made Abimelech king, by the oak of the pillar that was in Shechem.
Judges 9:7	And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood in the top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said unto them, Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, that God may hearken unto you.
Judges 9:8	The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they said unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us.
Judges 9:9	But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness, wherewith by me they honour God and man, and go to wave to and fro over the trees?
Judges 9:10	And the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou, and reign over us.
Judges 9:11	But the fig tree said unto them, Should I leave my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to wave to and fro over the trees?
Judges 9:12	And the trees said unto the vine, Come thou, and reign over us.
Judges 9:13	And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which cheereth God and man, and go to wave to and fro over the trees?
Judges 9:14	Then said all the trees unto the bramble, Come thou, and reign over us.
Judges 9:15	And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king over you, then come and put your trust in my shadow: and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.
Judges 9:16	Now therefore, if ye have dealt truly and uprightly, in that ye have made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands;
Judges 9:17	(for my father fought for you, and adventured his life, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian:
Judges 9:18	and ye are risen up against my father’s house this day, and have slain his sons, threescore and ten persons, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother;)
Judges 9:19	if ye then have dealt truly and uprightly with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you:
Judges 9:20	but if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech.
Judges 9:21	And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.
Judges 9:22	And Abimelech was prince over Israel three years.
Judges 9:23	And God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:
Judges 9:24	that the violence done to the threescore and ten sons of Jerubbaal might come, and that their blood might be laid upon Abimelech their brother, which slew them, and upon the men of Shechem, which strengthened his hands to slay his brethren.
Judges 9:25	And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him on the tops of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them: and it was told Abimelech.
Judges 9:26	And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their trust in him.
Judges 9:27	And they went out into the field, and gathered their vineyards, and trode the grapes, and held festival, and went into the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech.
Judges 9:28	And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? is not he the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve ye the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: but why should we serve him?
Judges 9:29	And would to God this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thine army, and come out.
Judges 9:30	And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.
Judges 9:31	And he sent messengers unto Abimelech craftily, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren are come to Shechem; and, behold, they constrain the city to take part against thee.
Judges 9:32	Now therefore, up by night, thou and the people that is with thee, and lie in wait in the field:
Judges 9:33	and it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, thou shalt rise early, and set upon the city: and, behold, when he and the people that is with him come out against thee, then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion.
Judges 9:34	And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.
Judges 9:35	And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people that were with him, from the ambushment.
Judges 9:36	And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the tops of the mountains. And Zebul said unto him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they were men.
Judges 9:37	And Gaal spake again and said, See, there come people down by the middle of the land, and one company cometh by the way of the oak of Meonenim.
Judges 9:38	Then said Zebul unto him, Where is now thy mouth, that thou saidst, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is not this the people that thou hast despised? go out now, I pray, and fight with them.
Judges 9:39	And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.
Judges 9:40	And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and there fell many wounded, even unto the entering of the gate.
Judges 9:41	And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul drave out Gaal and his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem.
Judges 9:42	And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech.
Judges 9:43	And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field; and he looked, and, behold, the people came forth out of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote them.
Judges 9:44	And Abimelech, and the companies that were with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and the two companies rushed upon all that were in the field, and smote them.
Judges 9:45	And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that was therein: and he beat down the city, and sowed it with salt.
Judges 9:46	And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard thereof, they entered into the hold of the house of El-berith.
Judges 9:47	And it was told Abimelech that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together.
Judges 9:48	And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it up, and laid it on his shoulder: and he said unto the people that were with him, What ye have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done.
Judges 9:49	And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.
Judges 9:50	Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.
Judges 9:51	But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut themselves in, and gat them up to the roof of the tower.
Judges 9:52	And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire.
Judges 9:53	And a certain woman cast an upper millstone upon Abimelech’s head, and brake his skull.
Judges 9:54	Then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer, and said unto him, Draw thy sword, and kill me, that men say not of me, A woman slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died.
Judges 9:55	And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man unto his place.
Judges 9:56	Thus God requited the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren:
Judges 9:57	and all the wickedness of the men of Shechem did God requite upon their heads: and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.
Judges 10:1	And after Abimelech there arose to save Israel Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim.
Judges 10:2	And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir.
Judges 10:3	And after him arose Jair, the Gileadite; and he judged Israel twenty and two years.
Judges 10:4	And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havvoth-jair unto this day, which are in the land of Gilead.
Judges 10:5	And Jair died, and was buried in Kamon.
Judges 10:6	And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, and served the Baalim, and the Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines; and they forsook the LORD, and served him not.
Judges 10:7	And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the children of Ammon.
Judges 10:8	And they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel that year: eighteen years oppressed they all the children of Israel that were beyond Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead.
Judges 10:9	And the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim; so that Israel was sore distressed.
Judges 10:10	And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, saying, We have sinned against thee, even because we have forsaken our God, and have served the Baalim.
Judges 10:11	And the LORD said unto the children of Israel, Did not I save you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines?
Judges 10:12	The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, did oppress you; and ye cried unto me, and I saved you out of their hand.
Judges 10:13	Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I will save you no more.
Judges 10:14	Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them save you in the time of your distress.
Judges 10:15	And the children of Israel said unto the LORD, We have sinned: do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee; only deliver us, we pray thee, this day.
Judges 10:16	And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served the LORD: and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.
Judges 10:17	Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled themselves together, and encamped in Mizpah.
Judges 10:18	And the people, the princes of Gilead, said one to another, What man is he that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.
Judges 11:1	Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour, and he was the son of an harlot: and Gilead begat Jephthah.
Judges 11:2	And Gilead’s wife bare him sons; and when his wife’s sons grew up, they drave out Jephthah, and said unto him, Thou shalt not inherit in our father’s house; for thou art the son of another woman.
Judges 11:3	Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob: and there were gathered vain fellows to Jephthah, and they went out with him.
Judges 11:4	And it came to pass after a while, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel.
Judges 11:5	And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob:
Judges 11:6	and they said unto Jephthah, Come and be our chief, that we may fight with the children of Ammon.
Judges 11:7	And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate me, and drive me out of my father’s house? and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress?
Judges 11:8	And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, Therefore are we turned again to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, and fight with the children of Ammon, and thou shalt be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.
Judges 11:9	And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home again to fight with the children of Ammon, and the LORD deliver them before me, shall I be your head?
Judges 11:10	And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, The LORD shall be witness between us; surely according to thy word so will we do.
Judges 11:11	Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and chief over them: and Jephthah spake all his words before the LORD in Mizpah.
Judges 11:12	And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come unto me to fight against my land?
Judges 11:13	And the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when he came up out of Egypt, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and unto Jordan: now therefore restore those lands again peaceably.
Judges 11:14	And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of Ammon:
Judges 11:15	and he said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah: Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon:
Judges 11:16	but when they came up from Egypt, and Israel walked through the wilderness unto the Red Sea, and came to Kadesh;
Judges 11:17	then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land: but the king of Edom hearkened not. And in like manner he sent unto the king of Moab: but he would not: and Israel abode in Kadesh.
Judges 11:18	Then he walked through the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and they pitched on the other side of Arnon; but they came not within the border of Moab, for Arnon was the border of Moab.
Judges 11:19	And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land unto my place.
Judges 11:20	But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and pitched in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.
Judges 11:21	And the LORD, the God of Israel, delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.
Judges 11:22	And they possessed all the border of the Amorites, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto Jordan.
Judges 11:23	So now the LORD, the God of Israel, hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possess them?
Judges 11:24	Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess? So whomsoever the LORD our God hath dispossessed from before us, them will we possess.
Judges 11:25	And now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them?
Judges 11:26	While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and her towns, and in all the cities that are along by the side of Arnon, three hundred years; wherefore did ye not recover them within that time?
Judges 11:27	I therefore have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me: the LORD, the Judge, be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.
Judges 11:28	Howbeit the king of the children Ammon hearkened not unto the words of Jephthah which he sent him.
Judges 11:29	Then the spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon.
Judges 11:30	And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver the children of Ammon into mine hand,
Judges 11:31	then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, it shall be the LORD’S, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.
Judges 11:32	So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hand.
Judges 11:33	And he smote them from Aroer until thou come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and unto Abel-cheramim, with a very great slaughter. So the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.
Judges 11:34	And Jephthah came to Mizpah unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.
Judges 11:35	And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the LORD, and I cannot go back.
Judges 11:36	And she said unto him, My father, thou hast opened thy mouth unto the LORD; do unto me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies, even of the children of Ammon.
Judges 11:37	And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may depart and go down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my companions.
Judges 11:38	And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she departed, she and her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains.
Judges 11:39	And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she had not known man. And it was a custom in Israel,
Judges 11:40	that the daughters of Israel went yearly to celebrate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.
Judges 12:1	And the men of Ephraim were gathered together, and passed northward; and they said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with thee? we will burn thine house upon thee with fire.
Judges 12:2	And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye saved me not out of their hand.
Judges 12:3	And when I saw that ye saved me not, I put my life in my hand, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the LORD delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day, to fight against me?
Judges 12:4	Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye are fugitives of Ephraim, ye Gileadites, in the midst of Ephraim, and in the midst of Manasseh.
Judges 12:5	And the Gileadites took the fords of Jordan against the Ephraimites: and it was so, that when any of the fugitives of Ephraim said, Let me go over, the men of Gilead said unto him, Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay;
Judges 12:6	then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth; and he said Sibboleth; for he could not frame to pronounce it right; then they laid hold on him, and slew him at the fords of Jordan: and there fell at that time of Ephraim forty and two thousand.
Judges 12:7	And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.
Judges 12:8	And after him Ibzan of Beth-lehem judged Israel.
Judges 12:9	And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters he sent abroad, and thirty daughters he brought in from abroad for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years.
Judges 12:10	And Ibzan died, and was buried at Beth-lehem.
Judges 12:11	And after him Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel; and he judged Israel ten years.
Judges 12:12	And Elon the Zebulunite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the land of Zebulun.
Judges 12:13	And after him Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel.
Judges 12:14	And he had forty sons and thirty sons’ sons, that rode on threescore and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel eight years.
Judges 12:15	And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites.
Judges 13:1	And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.
Judges 13:2	And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bare not.
Judges 13:3	And the angel of the LORD appeared unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not: but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son.
Judges 13:4	Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing:
Judges 13:5	for, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come upon his head: for the child shall be a Nazirite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.
Judges 13:6	Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of the angel of God, very terrible; and I asked him not whence he was, neither told he me his name:
Judges 13:7	but he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing: for the child shall be a Nazirite unto God from the womb to the day of his death.
Judges 13:8	Then Manoah entreated the LORD, and said, Oh Lord, I pray thee, let the man of God whom thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do onto the child that shall be born.
Judges 13:9	And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband was not with her.
Judges 13:10	And the woman made haste, and ran, and told her husband, and said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto me the other day.
Judges 13:11	And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said unto him, Art thou the man that spakest unto the woman? And he said, I am.
Judges 13:12	And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass: what shall be the manner of the child, and what shall be his work?
Judges 13:13	And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware.
Judges 13:14	She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing; all that I commanded her let her observe.
Judges 13:15	And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, I pray thee, let us detain thee, that we may make ready a kid for thee.
Judges 13:16	And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt make ready a burnt offering, thou must offer it onto the LORD. For Manoah knew not that he was the angel of the LORD.
Judges 13:17	And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, What is thy name, that when thy words come to pass we may do thee honour?
Judges 13:18	And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore askest thou after my name, seeing it is wonderful?
Judges 13:19	So Manoah took the kid with the meal offering, and offered it upon the rock unto the LORD: and the angel did wondrously, and Manoah and his wife looked on.
Judges 13:20	For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar: and Manoah and his wife looked on; and they fell on their faces to the ground.
Judges 13:21	But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah or to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was the angel of the LORD.
Judges 13:22	And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.
Judges 13:23	But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meal offering at our hand, neither would he have shewed us all these things, nor would at this time have told us such things as these.
Judges 13:24	And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and the LORD blessed him.
Judges 13:25	And the spirit of the LORD began to move him in Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.
Judges 14:1	And Samson went down to Timnah, and saw a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines.
Judges 14:2	And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife.
Judges 14:3	Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well.
Judges 14:4	But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the LORD; for he sought an occasion against the Philistines. Now at that time the Philistines had rule over Israel.
Judges 14:5	Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnah, and came to the vineyards of Timnah: and, behold, a young lion roared against him.
Judges 14:6	And the spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done.
Judges 14:7	And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well.
Judges 14:8	And after a while he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion, and honey.
Judges 14:9	And he took it into his hands, and went on, eating as he went, and he came to his father and mother, and gave unto them, and they did eat: but he told them not that he had taken the honey out of the body of the lion.
Judges 14:10	And his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.
Judges 14:11	And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.
Judges 14:12	And Samson said unto them, Let me now put forth a riddle unto you: if ye can declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of raiment:
Judges 14:13	but if ye cannot declare it me, then shall ye give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of raiment. And they said unto him, Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it.
Judges 14:14	And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days declare the riddle.
Judges 14:15	And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson’s wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father’s house with fire: have ye called us to impoverish us? is it not so?
Judges 14:16	And Samson’s wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and hast not told it me. And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told it my father nor my mother, and shall I tell it thee?
Judges 14:17	And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she pressed him sore: and she told the riddle to the children of her people.
Judges 14:18	And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? and what is stronger than a lion? And he said unto them, If ye had not plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle.
Judges 14:19	And the spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and smote thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave the changes of raiment unto them that declared the riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father’s house.
Judges 14:20	But Samson’s wife was given to his companion, whom he had used as his friend.
Judges 15:1	But it came to pass after a while, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him to go in.
Judges 15:2	And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: is not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her.
Judges 15:3	And Samson said unto them, This time shall I be blameless in regard of the Philistines, when I do them a mischief.
Judges 15:4	And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between every two tails.
Judges 15:5	And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks and the standing corn, and also the oliveyards.
Judges 15:6	Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they said, Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he hath taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.
Judges 15:7	And Samson said unto them, If ye do after this manner, surely I will be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.
Judges 15:8	And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and dwelt in the cleft of the rock of Etam.
Judges 15:9	Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.
Judges 15:10	And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And they said, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath done to us.
Judges 15:11	Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers over us? what then is this that thou hast done unto us? And he said unto them, As they did unto me, so have I done unto them.
Judges 15:12	And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said unto them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.
Judges 15:13	And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not kill thee. And they bound him with two new ropes, and brought him up from the rock.
Judges 15:14	When he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted as they met him: and the spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and the ropes that were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands dropped from off his hands.
Judges 15:15	And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and smote a thousand men therewith.
Judges 15:16	And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jawbone of an ass have I smitten a thousand men.
Judges 15:17	And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand; and that place was called Ramath-lehi.
Judges 15:18	And he was sore athirst, and called on the LORD, and said, Thou hast given this great deliverance by the hand of thy servant: and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised.
Judges 15:19	But God clave the hollow place that is in Lehi, and there came water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived: wherefore the name thereof was called En-hakkore, which is in Lehi, unto this day.
Judges 15:20	And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.
Judges 16:1	And Samson went to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in unto her.
Judges 16:2	And it was told the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither. And they compassed him in, and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, Let be till morning light, then we will kill him.
Judges 16:3	And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and laid hold of the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and plucked them up, bar and all, and put them upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of the mountain that is before Hebron.
Judges 16:4	And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.
Judges 16:5	And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength lieth, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him: and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver.
Judges 16:6	And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee.
Judges 16:7	And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withes that were never dried, then shall I become weak, and be as another man.
Judges 16:8	Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green withes which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.
Judges 16:9	Now she had liers in wait abiding in the inner chamber. And she said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he brake the withes, as a string of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known.
Judges 16:10	And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound.
Judges 16:11	And he said unto her, If they only bind me with new ropes wherewith no work hath been done, then shall I become weak, and be as another man.
Judges 16:12	So Delilah took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And the liers in wait were abiding in the inner chamber. And he brake them from off his arms like a thread.
Judges 16:13	And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.
Judges 16:14	And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and plucked away the pin of the beam, and the web.
Judges 16:15	And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thine heart is not with me? thou hast mocked me these three times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth.
Judges 16:16	And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, that his soul was vexed unto death.
Judges 16:17	And he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath not come a razor upon mine head; for I have been a Nazirite unto God from my mother’s womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man.
Judges 16:18	And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he hath told me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought the money in their hand.
Judges 16:19	And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and shaved off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.
Judges 16:20	And she said, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times, and shake myself. But he wist not that the LORD was departed from him.
Judges 16:21	And the Philistines laid hold on him, and put out his eyes; and they brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison house.
Judges 16:22	Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven.
Judges 16:23	And the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.
Judges 16:24	And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they said, Our god hath delivered into our hand our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, which hath slain many of us.
Judges 16:25	And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison house; and he made sport before them: and they set him between the pillars.
Judges 16:26	and Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house resteth, that I may lean upon them.
Judges 16:27	Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport.
Judges 16:28	And Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, remember member me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.
Judges 16:29	And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house rested, and leaned upon them, the one with his right hand, and the other with his left.
Judges 16:30	And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that were therein. So the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life.
Judges 16:31	Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the buryingplace of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years.
Judges 17:1	And there was a man of the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Micah.
Judges 17:2	And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred pieces of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou didst utter a curse, and didst also speak it in mine ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be my son of the LORD.
Judges 17:3	And he restored the eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother, and his mother said, I verily dedicate the silver unto the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto thee.
Judges 17:4	And when he restored the money unto his mother, his mother took two hundred pieces of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and it was in the house of Micah.
Judges 17:5	And the man Micah had an house of gods, and he made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.
Judges 17:6	In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.
Judges 17:7	And there was a young man out of Beth-lehem-judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there.
Judges 17:8	And the man departed out of the city, out of Beth-lehem-judah, to sojourn where he could find a place: and he came to the hill country of Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.
Judges 17:9	And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I am a Levite of Beth-lehem-judah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a place.
Judges 17:10	And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten pieces of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in.
Judges 17:11	And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons.
Judges 17:12	And Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.
Judges 17:13	Then said Micah, Now know I that the LORD will do me good, seeing I have a Levite to my priest.
Judges 18:1	In those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for unto that day their inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of Israel.
Judges 18:2	And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their whole number, men of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them, Go, search the land: and they came to the hill country of Ephraim, unto the house of Micah, and lodged there.
Judges 18:3	When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite: and they turned aside thither, and said unto him, Who brought thee hither? and what doest thou in this place? and what hast thou here?
Judges 18:4	And he said unto them, Thus and thus hath Micah dealt with me, and he hath hired me, and I am become his priest.
Judges 18:5	And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.
Judges 18:6	And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before the LORD is your way wherein ye go.
Judges 18:7	Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that were therein, how they dwelt in security, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; for there was none in the land, possessing authority, that might put them to shame in any thing, and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no dealings with any man.
Judges 18:8	And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brethren said unto them, What say ye?
Judges 18:9	And they said, Arise, and let us go up against them: for we have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good: and are ye still? be not slofthful to go and to enter in to possess the land.
Judges 18:10	When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and the land is large: for God hath given it into your hand; a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth.
Judges 18:11	And there set forth from thence of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men girt with weapons of war.
Judges 18:12	And they went up, and encamped in Kiriath-jearim, in Judah: wherefore they called that place Mahaneh-dan unto this day: behold, it is behind Kirjath-jearim.
Judges 18:13	And they passed thence unto the hill country of Ephraim, and came unto the house of Micah.
Judges 18:14	Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish, and said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to do.
Judges 18:15	And they turned aside thither, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, even unto the house of Micah, and asked him of his welfare.
Judges 18:16	And the six hundred men girt with their weapons of war, who were of the children of Dan, stood by the entering of the gate.
Judges 18:17	And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came in thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood by the entering of the gate with the six hundred men girt with weapons of war.
Judges 18:18	And when these went into Micah’s house and fetched the graven image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image, the priest said unto them, What do ye?
Judges 18:19	And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thine hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: is it better for thee to be priest unto the house of one man, or to be priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel?
Judges 18:20	And the priest’s heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people.
Judges 18:21	So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the goods before them.
Judges 18:22	When they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that were in the houses near to Micah’s house were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan.
Judges 18:23	And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said unto Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company?
Judges 18:24	And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and are gone away, and what have I more? and how then say ye unto me, What aileth thee?
Judges 18:25	And the children of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows fall upon you, and thou lose thy life, with the lives of thy household.
Judges 18:26	And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back unto his house.
Judges 18:27	And they took that which Micah had made, and the priest which he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people quiet and secure, and smote them with the edge of the sword; and they burnt the city with fire.
Judges 18:28	And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and they had no dealings with any man; and it was in the valley that lieth by Beth-rehob. And they built the city, and dwelt therein.
Judges 18:29	And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name of the city was Laish at the first.
Judges 18:30	And the children of Dan set up for themselves the graven image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the land.
Judges 18:31	So they set them up Micah’s graven image which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.
Judges 19:1	And it came to pass in these days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the farther side of the hill country of Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Beth-lehem-judah.
Judges 19:2	And his concubine played the harlot against him, and went away from him unto her father’s house to Beth-lehem-judah, and was there the space of four months.
Judges 19:3	And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak kindly unto her, to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple of asses: and she brought him into her father’s house: and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.
Judges 19:4	And his father in law, the damsel’s father, retained him; and he abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and lodged there.
Judges 19:5	And it came to pass on the fourth day, that they arose early in the morning, and he rose up to depart: and the damsel’s father said unto his son in law, Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward ye shall go your way.
Judges 19:6	So they sat down, and did eat and drink, both of them together: and the damsel’s father said unto the man, Be content, I pray thee, and tarry all night, and let thine heart be merry.
Judges 19:7	And the man rose up to depart; but his father in law urged him, and he lodged there again.
Judges 19:8	And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and the damsel’s father said, Comfort thine heart, I pray thee, and tarry ye until the day declineth; and they did eat, both of them.
Judges 19:9	And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father in law, the damsel’s father, said unto him, Behold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you tarry all night: behold, the day groweth to an end, lodge here, that thine heart may be merry; and tomorrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home.
Judges 19:10	But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against Jebus (the same is Jerusalem): and there were with him a couple of asses saddled; his concubine also was with him.
Judges 19:11	When they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said unto his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.
Judges 19:12	And his master said unto him, We will not turn aside into the city of a stranger, that is not of the children of Israel; but we will pass over to Gibeah.
Judges 19:13	And he said unto his servant, Come and let us draw near to one of these places; and we will lodge in Gibeah, or in Ramah.
Judges 19:14	So they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them near to Gibeah, which belongeth to Benjamin.
Judges 19:15	And they turned aside thither, to go in to lodge in Gibeah: and he went in, and sat him down in the street of the city: for there was no man that took them into his house to lodge.
Judges 19:16	And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even; now the man was of the hill country of Ephraim, and he sojourned in Gibeah: but the men of the place were Benjamites.
Judges 19:17	And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the wayfaring man in the street of the city; and the old man said, Whither goest thou? and whence comest thou?
Judges 19:18	And he said unto him, We are passing from Beth-lehem-judah unto the farther side of the hill country of Ephraim; from thence am I, and I went to Beth-lehem-judah: and I am now going to the house of the LORD; and there is no man that taketh me into his house.
Judges 19:19	Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young man which is with thy servants: there is no want of any thing.
Judges 19:20	And the old man said, Peace be unto thee; howsoever let all thy wants lie upon me; only lodge not in the street.
Judges 19:21	So he brought him into his house, and gave the asses fodder: and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink.
Judges 19:22	As they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about, beating at the door; and they spake to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into thine house, that we may know him.
Judges 19:23	And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and said unto them, Nay, my brethren, I pray you, do not so wickedly; seeing that this man is come into mine house, do not this folly.
Judges 19:24	Behold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth good unto you: but unto this man do not any such folly.
Judges 19:25	But the men would not hearken to him: so the man laid hold on his concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go.
Judges 19:26	Then came the woman in the dawning of the day and fell down at the door of the man’s house where her lord was, till it was light.
Judges 19:27	And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way: and, behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, with her hands upon the threshold.
Judges 19:28	And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going; but none answered: then he took her up upon the ass; and the man rose up, and gat him unto his place.
Judges 19:29	And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, limb by limb, into twelve pieces, and sent her throughout all the borders of Israel.
Judges 19:30	And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day: consider of it, take counsel, and speak.
Judges 20:1	Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was assembled as one man, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, with the land of Gilead, unto the LORD at Mizpah.
Judges 20:2	And the chiefs of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.
Judges 20:3	(Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to Mizpah.) And the children of Israel said, Tell us, how was this wickedness brought to pass?
Judges 20:4	And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was murdered, answered and said, I came into Gibeah that belongeth to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.
Judges 20:5	And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round about upon me by night; me they thought to have slain, and my concubine they forced, and she is dead.
Judges 20:6	And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel: for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.
Judges 20:7	Behold, ye children of Israel, all of you, give here your advice and counsel.
Judges 20:8	And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any of us go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn unto his house.
Judges 20:9	But now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah; we will go up against it by lot;
Judges 20:10	and we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and an hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch victual for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel.
Judges 20:11	So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man.
Judges 20:12	And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is come to pass among you?
Judges 20:13	Now therefore deliver up the men, the sons of Belial, which are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel. But Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel.
Judges 20:14	And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel.
Judges 20:15	And the children of Benjamin were numbered on that day out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, which were numbered seven hundred chosen men.
Judges 20:16	Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men lefthanded; every one could sling stones at an hair-breadth, and not miss.
Judges 20:17	And the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these were men of war.
Judges 20:18	And the children of Israel arose, and went up to Beth-el, and asked counsel of God; and they said, Who shall go up for us first to battle against the children of Benjamin? And the LORD said, Judah shall go up first.
Judges 20:19	And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah.
Judges 20:20	And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel set the battle in array against them at Gibeah.
Judges 20:21	And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites on that day twenty and two thousand men.
Judges 20:22	And the people, the men of Israel, encouraged themselves, and set the battle again in array in the place where they set themselves in array the first day.
Judges 20:23	(And the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until even; and they asked of the LORD, saying, Shall I again draw nigh to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother? And the LORD said, Go up against him.)
Judges 20:24	And the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day.
Judges 20:25	And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.
Judges 20:26	Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came unto Beth-el, and wept, and sat there before the LORD, and fasted that day until even; and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.
Judges 20:27	And the children of Israel asked of the LORD, (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,
Judges 20:28	and Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And the LORD said, Go up; for tomorrow I will deliver him into thine hand.
Judges 20:29	And Israel set liers in wait against Gibeah round about.
Judges 20:30	And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and set themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times.
Judges 20:31	And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite and kill of the people, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goeth up to Beth-el, and the other to Gibeah, in the field, about thirty men of Israel.
Judges 20:32	And the children of Benjamin said, They are smitten down before us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said, Let us rise, and draw them away from the city unto the highways.
Judges 20:33	And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and set themselves in array at Baal-tamar: and the liers in wait of Israel brake forth out of their place, even out of Maareh-geba.
Judges 20:34	And there came over against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was sore: but they knew not that evil was close upon them.
Judges 20:35	And the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel: and the children of Israel destroyed of Benjamin that day twenty and five thousand and an hundred men: all these drew the sword.
Judges 20:36	So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for the men of Israel gave place to Benjamin, because they trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set against Gibeah.
Judges 20:37	And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers in wait drew themselves along, and smote all the city with the edge of the sword.
Judges 20:38	Now the appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers in wait was, that they should make a great cloud of smoke rise up out of the city.
Judges 20:39	And the men of Israel turned in the battle, and Benjamin began to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons: for they said, Surely they are smitten down before us, as in the first battle.:
Judges 20:40	But when the cloud began to arise up out of the city in a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold, the whole of the city went up in smoke to heaven.
Judges 20:41	And the men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were amazed: for they saw that evil was come upon them.
Judges 20:42	Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness; but the battle followed hard after them; and they which came out of the cities destroyed them in the midst thereof.
Judges 20:43	They enclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased them, and trode them down at their resting place, as far as over against Gibeah toward the sunrising.
Judges 20:44	And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were men of valour.
Judges 20:45	And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and followed hard after them unto Gidom, and smote of them two thousand men.
Judges 20:46	So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of valour.
Judges 20:47	But six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon, and abode in the rock of Rimmon four months.
Judges 20:48	And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, both the entire city, and the cattle and all that they found: moreover all the cities which they found they set on fire.
Judges 21:1	Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpah, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife.
Judges 21:2	And the people came to Beth-el, and sat there till even before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore.
Judges 21:3	And they said, O LORD, the God of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel, that there should be today one tribe lacking in Israel?
Judges 21:4	And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.
Judges 21:5	And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that came not up in the assembly unto the LORD? For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up unto the LORD to Mizpah, saying, He shall surely be put to death.
Judges 21:6	And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.
Judges 21:7	How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by the LORD that we will not give them of our daughters to wives?
Judges 21:8	And they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up unto the LORD to Mizpah? And, behold, there came none to the camp from Jabesh-gilead to the assembly.
Judges 21:9	For when the people were numbered, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead there.
Judges 21:10	And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the little ones.
Judges 21:11	And this is the thing that ye shall do; ye shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by man.
Judges 21:12	And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four hundred young virgins, that had not known man by lying with him: and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.
Judges 21:13	And the whole congregation sent and spake to the children of Benjamin that were in the rock of Rimmon, and proclaimed peace unto them.
Judges 21:14	And Benjamin returned at that time; and they gave them the women which they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh-gilead: and yet so they sufficed them not.
Judges 21:15	And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.
Judges 21:16	Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?
Judges 21:17	And they said, There must be an inheritance for them that are escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not blotted out from Israel.
Judges 21:18	Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the children of Israel had sworn, saying, Cursed be he that giveth a wife to Benjamin.
Judges 21:19	And they said, Behold, there is a feast of the LORD from year to year in Shiloh, which is on the north of Beth-el, on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Beth-el to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.
Judges 21:20	And they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards;
Judges 21:21	and see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in the dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.
Judges 21:22	And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come to complain unto us, that we will say unto them, Grant them graciously unto us: because we took not for each man of them his wife in battle: neither did ye give them unto them; else would ye now be guilty.
Judges 21:23	And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they carried off: and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and built the cities, and dwelt in them.
Judges 21:24	And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance.
Judges 21:25	In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.
Ruth 1:1	And it came to pass in the days when the judges judged, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Beth-lehem-judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.
Ruth 1:2	And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Beth-lehem-judah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.
Ruth 1:3	And Elimelech Naomi’s husband died; and she was left, and her two sons.
Ruth 1:4	And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about ten years.
Ruth 1:5	And Mahlon and Chilion died both of them; and the woman was left of her two children and of her husband.
Ruth 1:6	Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread.
Ruth 1:7	And she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah.
Ruth 1:8	And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each of you to her mother’s house: the LORD deal kindly with you as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.
Ruth 1:9	The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.
Ruth 1:10	And they said unto her, Nay, but we will return with thee unto thy people.
Ruth 1:11	And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? have I yet sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?
Ruth 1:12	Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should even have an husband to-night, and should also bear sons;
Ruth 1:13	would ye therefore tarry till they were grown? would ye therefore stay from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes, for the hand of the LORD is gone forth against me.
Ruth 1:14	And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her.
Ruth 1:15	And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her god: return thou after thy sister in law.
Ruth 1:16	And Ruth said, Entreat me not to leave thee, and to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God:
Ruth 1:17	where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also, if aught but death part thee and me.
Ruth 1:18	And when she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, she left speaking unto her.
Ruth 1:19	So they two went until they came to Beth-lehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Beth-lehem, that all the city was moved about them, and the women said, Is this Naomi?
Ruth 1:20	And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.
Ruth 1:21	I went out full, and the LORD hath brought me home again empty: why call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?
Ruth 1:22	So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Beth-lehem in the beginning of barley harvest.
Ruth 2:1	And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband’s, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz.
Ruth 2:2	And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean among the ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find grace. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter.
Ruth 2:3	And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light on the portion of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.
Ruth 2:4	And, behold, Boaz came from Beth-lehem, and said unto the reapers, The LORD be with you. And they answered him, The LORD bless thee.
Ruth 2:5	Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this? r
Ruth 2:6	And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab:
Ruth 2:7	And she said, Let me glean, I pray you, and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, save that she tarried a little in the house.
Ruth 2:8	Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither pass from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens.
Ruth 2:9	Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.
Ruth 2:10	Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thy sight, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?
Ruth 2:11	And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine husband: and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore.
Ruth 2:12	The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of the LORD, the God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to take refuge.
Ruth 2:13	Then she said, Let me find grace in thy sight, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken kindly unto thine handmaid, though I be not as one of thine handmaidens.
Ruth 2:14	And at meal-time Boaz said unto her, Come hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and they reached her parched corn, and she did eat, and was sufficed, and left thereof.
Ruth 2:15	And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not.
Ruth 2:16	And also pull out some for her from the bundles, and leave it, and let her glean, and rebuke her not.
Ruth 2:17	So she gleaned in the field until even; and she beat out that she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.
Ruth 2:18	And she took it up, and went into the city: and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth and gave to her that she had left after she was sufficed.
Ruth 2:19	And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned today? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee. And she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man’s name with whom I wrought today is Boaz.
Ruth 2:20	And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the LORD, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man is nigh of kin unto us, one of our near kinsmen.
Ruth 2:21	And Ruth the Moabitess said, Yea, he said unto me, Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.
Ruth 2:22	And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, and that they meet thee not in any other field.
Ruth 2:23	So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and she dwelt with her mother in law.
Ruth 3:1	And Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?
Ruth 3:2	And now is there not Boaz our kinsman, with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to-night in the threshing-floor.
Ruth 3:3	Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put on thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the threshing-floor: but make not thyself known to the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.
Ruth 3:4	And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do.
Ruth 3:5	And she said unto her, All that thou sayest I will do.
Ruth 3:6	And she went down unto the threshing-floor, and did according to all that her mother in law bade her.
Ruth 3:7	And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.
Ruth 3:8	And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.
Ruth 3:9	And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thine handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for thou art a near kinsman.
Ruth 3:10	And he said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my daughter: thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether poor or rich.
Ruth 3:11	And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou sayest: for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman.
Ruth 3:12	And now it is true that I am a near kinsman: howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than I.
Ruth 3:13	Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman’s part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee, as the LORD liveth: lie down until the morning.
Ruth 3:14	And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up before one could discern another. For he said, Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing-floor.
Ruth 3:15	And he said, Bring the mantle that is upon thee, and hold it; and she held it: and he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her: and he went into the city.
Ruth 3:16	And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who art thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.
Ruth 3:17	And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he said, Go not empty unto thy mother in law.
Ruth 3:18	Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall: for the man will not rest, until he have finished the thing this day.
Ruth 4:1	Now Boaz went up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the near kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down.
Ruth 4:2	And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down.
Ruth 4:3	And he said unto the near kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, selleth the parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech’s:
Ruth 4:4	And I thought to disclose it unto thee, saying, Buy it before them that sit here, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it beside thee; and I am after thee. And he said, I will redeem it.
Ruth 4:5	Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.
Ruth 4:6	And the near kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance: take thou my right of redemption on thee; for I cannot redeem it.
Ruth 4:7	Now this was the custom in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging, for to confirm all things; a man drew off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour: and this was the manner of attestation in Israel.
Ruth 4:8	So the near kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for thyself. And he drew off his shoe.
Ruth 4:9	And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech’s, and all that was Chilion’s and Mahlon’s, of the hand of Naomi.
Ruth 4:10	Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye are witnesses this day.
Ruth 4:11	And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come into thine house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephrathah, and be famous in Beth-lehem:
Ruth 4:12	and let thy house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bare unto Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this young woman.
Ruth 4:13	So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife; and he went in unto her, and the LORD gave her conception, and she bare a son.
Ruth 4:14	And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the LORD, which hath not left thee this day without a near kinsman, and let his name be famous in Israel.
Ruth 4:15	And he shall be unto thee a restorer of life, and a nourisher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which loveth thee, which is better to thee than seven sons, hath borne him.
Ruth 4:16	And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it.
Ruth 4:17	And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David.
Ruth 4:18	Now these are the generations of Perez: Perez begat Hezron;
Ruth 4:19	and Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab;
Ruth 4:20	and Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon;
Ruth 4:21	and Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed;
Ruth 4:22	and Obed begat J
